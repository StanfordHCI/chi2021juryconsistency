1,"<b>niceRhino</b>: Hello!  <br><b>culturedCow</b>: Hi! <br><b>spryBison</b>: Hello <br><b>youngLion</b>: Hi <br><b>smallGiraffe</b>: hi <br><b>culturedBear</b>: hello <br><b>smallGiraffe</b>: I don't think the guy is the a$$hole. Thoughts? <br><b>spryBison</b>: So who thinks the guy is an ass for asking his mother in law to learn english <br><b>niceRhino</b>: I think that this person is not an asshole because, according to him, he was very polite while approaching the issue <br><b>youngLion</b>: I can see how the family is upset because they feel the mother was disrespected but I can also understand the guy's feelings. Why should he have to work as interpreter for his mother in law? <br><b>niceRhino</b>: Yes, I think his feeling makes sense to me to. Who doesn't want to be independent. <br><b>culturedCow</b>: I was conflicted because I could understand his frustration however I feel he should have maybe discussed strategies with how to approach the mother in law with his wife first. <br><b>smallGiraffe</b>: His MIL has been here for 8 years. You would think she'd pick up some English by now. <br><b>spryBison</b>: I think he had every right to want to help his mother in law <br><b>niceRhino</b>: I also agree with culturedCow <br><b>youngLion</b>: I don't think he's an asshole. I think his request is reasonable. If you go to live in a foreign country, you should learn the language. <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: I think the guy is an asshole because for all his talk about how easy it is to use resources to learn a language, he didn't take the time to research WHY some people do not. <br><b>niceRhino</b>: I think he also tried to utilize other resources such as language learning apps to help her learn <br><b>culturedCow</b>: I think also he needs to understand that language learning is not the same for everyone, not everyone has the same capacity to learn new languages quickly. <br><b>youngLion</b>: Maybe she does have a problem with learning languages, but she could at least try. <br><b>spryBison</b>: After the edit he done it made it sound like he really loves his family <br><b>culturedBear</b>: I don't think the guy is wrong in asking her to learn more english being that she lives in America, but he has to understand she is older and may not have the patience or capacity to learn a lot of english. <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: Learning a second language is easiest when you're a child for a reason. Your brain is wired differently then, which makes it easier. <br><b>smallGiraffe</b>: I think he tried to help her.  He gave her resources to use and she apparently didn't use them. <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: Older people can have a hard time because of brain. intelligence and cognitive limits. It's not so easy to just read a book or dictionary after a certain point. <br><b>culturedCow</b>: I don't think he's an asshole for having the feelings he does, but I do think he is a bit of an asshole for handling it the way that he did without discussing it with his wife first or maybe finding a better way to approach it. <br><b>youngLion</b>: I think he wouldn't be so upset about it if she at least tried. <br><b>culturedBear</b>: He should also ask his wife to step up and talk to the mother to healp her learn more and to make herself more available to her mother to help with translations. <br><b>smallGiraffe</b>: I agree that learning a foreign language as an adult is more difficult but 8 years is a long time. <br><b>niceRhino</b>: I think that both sides have right and wrong. But overall i think he's not an asshole because of the way he approached the issue (politely) and because he also tried in his own way (although some of us may say not effective) to help her <br><b>youngLion</b>: Yes, why can't other members of the family help their mother? If they think he's being a jerk, they should step in.  I <br><b>niceRhino</b>: What are your verdicts? <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: If he doesn't want to help, that's fine, but dictating what his MIL, who I assume is not so young, should do is complete asshole-ry. <br><b>spryBison</b>: I think he is a nice person trying to relieve some stress off his plate by asking his mother in law to be more responsible. <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: Yes, asshole, all the way. <br><b>youngLion</b>: Not an asshole <br><b>culturedBear</b>: MIL is at least 20 years older than the couple so 8 years is a long time but how often is she interacting with other Americans. <br><b>spryBison</b>: We all have to agree <br><b>culturedCow</b>: Yeah I am also inclined to vote 'asshole' just because something seems fishy that the entire family freaked out on him, so I don't know if he was as polite as he claimed he was. <br><b>smallGiraffe</b>: I think his family is partally dorrect for being upset because of his approach. <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: I descent. Asshole still for me. <br><b>spryBison</b>: Asswhole it is <br><b>culturedBear</b>: The guy is not wrong and definitely not a racist. <br><b>littleSquirrel</b>: I think he should consider the fact that for some reason some people always tend to be dependent especially coming from a specific culture and upbringing - especially women and elderly. <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: No, he's not a racist, agrred. <br><b>spryBison</b>: we can call him a nice asswhole <br><b>youngLion</b>: I will go with the group and vote asshole. <br><b>culturedBear</b>: The guy just wants MIL to put in more effort, if possible. <br><b>niceRhino</b>: I believe that this person is not an asshole because he tried to help the MIL. <br><b>spryBison</b>: Asshole <br><b>smallGiraffe</b>: I agree with niceRhino <br><b>smallGiraffe</b>: I don't think he's the asshole <br>"
2,"<b>newLion</b>: hi <br><b>likelyRabbit</b>: I don't think she's the asshole because she's extremely busy. <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: howdy <br><b>newLion</b>: This girl seems like an asshole <br><b>littleCow</b>: Hello <br><b>likelyRabbit</b>: Her husband knows Spanish and communicates well with it. <br><b>littleCow</b>: I don't think she's an asshole, she clearly has more on her plate so it shouldn't be an issue for her husband to help relieve some of that burden. <br><b>likelyRabbit</b>: If she weren't so busy, I'd say she was an asshole but she's got a very full plate <br><b>newLion</b>: He married the daughter not the mother <br><b>newPanda</b>: I'm on the fence about this one. She may be busy but how often is her mother really bothering her husband? How long have they lived in the US? Information is missing as far as I'm concerned. <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: I think she's an asshole. Her husband has the right to not want to be a translator. It's his choice and he shouldn't be forced. <br><b>likelyRabbit</b>: Yes, he married the daughter but his MIL is now family too. <br><b>newLion</b>: true conventionalMonkey conventionalMonkey <br><b>likelyGorilla</b>: She says ""she just passes it on to her husband"", if her husband sees that she doesn't try to put in any efforts to help her parents with such issues, then why would he care either? <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: But then again, I think many Latino families are more egalitarian in that they expect everyone to contribute more. <br><b>newPanda</b>: I agree conventionalMonkey While they are his in-laws, they are her family.  <br><b>newLion</b>: I think the mother needs to find an alternative <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: Her stance is probably more of a culture perspective than an asshole-y one. <br><b>likelyRabbit</b>: I haven't personally gone for my Masters but I have gone to college.  That's a ton of work she's doing. <br><b>newLion</b>: The have google translator on phones <br><b>newPanda</b>: We are only hearing her side of it too. I agree newLion  the MIL could find other people to translate. <br><b>littleCow</b>: I feel there is also some cultural things that need to be taken into account. There maybe a difference between hers and her husband's, but I don't think that makes her an asshole. <br><b>newLion</b>: I say nice asshole <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: I think she should ask her husband when and if he's available to translate beforehand. <br><b>likelyGorilla</b>: She should expect to do more herself than expecting her husband to help every time. Once in a while, if the husband can be of help, then it's great. But can't be expected to help all the time, when she ""just passes on"" <br><b>likelyRabbit</b>: newLion Great point.  Maybe they can educate her mom. <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: Just having mom call out of the blue is unacceptable to me. <br><b>newLion</b>: But the mother quit going through the daughter and started calling him directly. <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: I have considered both sides. While I don't dislike this person, I think her expectations of her husband are somewhat asshole-y. <br><b>newLion</b>: I say asshole <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: I think the daughter made the mother think it was okay to just call directly. <br><b>likelyRabbit</b>: I still say not an asshole.  She's very busy. <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: She's so busy, she wanted to stop being the middleman. <br><b>newPanda</b>: I understand wanting to help her parents but I think there is also an issue with this woman using her husband. She is an asshole. <br><b>likelyGorilla</b>: Every relationship has limitation in terms of expectation. If the husband willingly helps, that's great. If not, she should nicely try to approach him for helping out <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: Asshole with reservations from me. <br><b>newLion</b>: Maybe she needs to take some off her plate <br><b>littleCow</b>: Yeah, I'm not convinced she's an asshole. I do think the situation could be settled in a way that's more ideal to both parties, but she's working full time and going through her Master's which is a lot. <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: If only there was choice beside yay or nay. <br><b>likelyRabbit</b>: I agree littleCow <br><b>newLion</b>: I say asshole under stress <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: Yes, she is the asshole... unfortunately. Husband has stuff to do too and is entitled to not want to translate at her mother's whim. <br><b>newPanda</b>: I think she is being presumptuous and acting like her husband's feelings don't matter.  <br><b>newLion</b>: Tha's true, she ins't considering her husband and his feelings <br><b>likelyRabbit</b>: I don't agree.  Not the asshole.  She's too busy. <br>"
3,"<b>culturedPanda</b>: That person is definitely an asshole, I honestly don't care that the person can <br><b>newHippo</b>: This guy doesn't seem to understand the delicacy of this issue. <br><b>culturedPanda</b>: learn a bunch of languages, expecting an elderly to do the same is unfair. <br><b>littleSquirrel</b>: I think they're an asshole because of how they approached it. They could have said - hey, I'm a little overwhelmed by all this, which is valid <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: I don't think he was being an asshole. He was actually very polite. He loves his Latino family. He wants to teach them English. <br><b>newHippo</b>: Yes, he's definitely not being sensitive. <br><b>culturedPanda</b>: con <br><b>youngPig</b>: Yes, he is the asshole. Just because he had no trouble learning new languages doesn't mean everyone can. The older people get, the harder learning language is. <br><b>culturedPanda</b>: Exactly youngPig <br><b>culturedPanda</b>: conventionalMonkey <br><b>culturedPanda</b>: What if they don't want to learn? <br><b>spryGorilla</b>: It sounds like he reached his boiling point and she called at a bad time so he reached his breaking point <br><b>newHippo</b>: It seems like if we're all going toa gree it'd be easier to make the case for him being an asshole. <br><b>newHippo</b>: LOgistically it makes mroe sense anyways, although he was kind of douchey. <br><b>conventionalDonkey</b>: ControversialMonkey i agree with you <br><b>littleSquirrel</b>: I don't think that's fair, newHippo People have the right to share opinions, even if differing <br><b>culturedPanda</b>: ^ <br><b>culturedPanda</b>: I agree with sq <br><b>newHippo</b>: Okay, but we all ahve to agree, and I wouldnt give him a pass for his lack of foresight. <br><b>culturedPanda</b>: It's realistically not reasonable to ask for someone to learn a new language <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: I still think he was being polite <br><b>culturedPanda</b>: The elders raised her daughter fine without english, and all of a sudden the dude that she marries is making them learn? <br><b>youngPig</b>: He seems arrogant because he thinks it's as easy for everyone else to learn a language as it was for him. <br><b>spryGorilla</b>: On one side he did learn portuges and rusian in two years. <br><b>littleSquirrel</b>: You can be polite and still be wrong <br><b>culturedPanda</b>: I agree youngPig <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: He wasn't trying to offend them <br><b>spryGorilla</b>: The lady has been in this country for 8 years and still cant speak english. <br><b>conventionalDonkey</b>: 🐵 👍 <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: 8 years is a long time <br><b>culturedPanda</b>: spryGorilla What is your point?  <br><b>spryGorilla</b>: I dont think he is a asshole in real life but just had a bad day. <br><b>youngPig</b>: If he doesn't want to help her translate, that's fine. But emphasizing 'learn the language' is what makes him the asshole. <br><b>newHippo</b>: I dont judge at all, but I'mma vote him the asshole.  <br><b>culturedPanda</b>: They live in an area full of hispanics, she realistically did not need to learn english for 8 yyears <br><b>littleSquirrel</b>: How many languages can you speak, spryGorilla <br><b>culturedPanda</b>: Asshole <br><b>spryGorilla</b>: yes a asshole <br><b>littleSquirrel</b>: Asshole <br><b>conventionalDonkey</b>: Personal experience, My ex girlfriend went through school and still doesnt know english.  <br><b>culturedPanda</b>: Yeah how many can you speak <br><b>conventionalMonkey</b>: I don't think he was an asshole <br><b>spryGorilla</b>: yes this person acted as an asshole this day. <br><b>culturedPanda</b>: agreed, asshole <br>"
4,"<b>newCow</b>: There are some people who believe if you marry a person that you marry their family, but that only works if you have a family. <br><b>littleHorse</b>: I think she is an asshole. He should not be expected to have to translate everything for his family in law. <br><b>littleHorse</b>: Besides, why can't she just do it? <br><b>newCow</b>: It also only REALLY works if you talk about the subject explicitly before getting married. <br><b>likelySquirrel</b>: She isn't the asshole. She's working on a better life for everyone involved. <br><b>conventionalGorilla</b>: I think she is an asshole because her husband is obviously unhappy. <br><b>newCow</b>: If she told him he was in for this type of treatment before hand, sure.  <br><b>conventionalGorilla</b>: I think you have a responsibility to listen to your spouse. <br><b>newCow</b>: But she probably didn't. <br><b>newCow</b>: I think she's an asshole. <br><b>likelySquirrel</b>: The husband has more free time and it's a way he can contribute to helping the family. <br><b>littleHorse</b>: It's not his family though <br><b>conventionalGorilla</b>: I understand being busy with her Master's, but I don't understand why they...just can't talk about it? <br><b>littleHorse</b>: He didn't marry his spouse's wife <br><b>conventionalGorilla</b>: I feel like this could be solved with better communication tbh. <br><b>littleHorse</b>: mother* <br><b>littleHorse</b>: Yeah <br><b>likelySquirrel</b>: He married her. They became family. <br><b>littleHorse</b>: It;'s not a huge deal, sit down, communicate and it could all be solved <br><b>littleHorse</b>: Exactly. He married her, to help take care of her, and his and her's kids. Not her mom <br><b>likelySquirrel</b>: There probably is a compromise that can be explored, but it doesn't make her an asshole. <br><b>newCow</b>: I think we should all vote her the asshole either way. <br><b>newCow</b>: Even if she's not wrong, the idea is to be able to get along. <br><b>conventionalGorilla</b>: I think she's the asshole because she thinks she's not wrong. She never mentioned her husband's feelings. <br><b>littleHorse</b>: I think to look at both sides, what likelySquirrel said would make sense but she's still an asshole <br><b>littleHorse</b>: Exactly. <br><b>likelySquirrel</b>: Family is about who came before AND after. <br><b>likelySquirrel</b>: All generations should be considered <br><b>littleHorse</b>: Well, I wouldn't get married to anyone if it meant becoming a full time translator. <br><b>littleBear</b>: i believe that you sholud always help out family. <br><b>conventionalGorilla</b>: I think that's a cultural difference, <br><b>likelySquirrel</b>: littleHorse nobody said it's fulltime. <br><b>littleHorse</b>: You should help them out, but to a certain extent. Becoming a full time translator would be a no for me <br><b>littleHorse</b>: It is though, it explicitly sayus <br><b>littleHorse</b>: she calls whenever she has a probblem <br><b>littleHorse</b>: hence, full time <br><b>littleBear</b>: I would not want to be a translater <br><b>likelySquirrel</b>: It's an occasional thing. He isn't following her around 24/7 <br><b>littleHorse</b>: But he;s on call 24/7. <br><b>littleBear</b>: i dont think this person was an asshole <br><b>littleHorse</b>: If it was occasional, I'm sure he wouldn't be irrtated. <br><b>likelySquirrel</b>: And it's just a phone call. <br>"
5,"<b>spryOrangutan</b>: Hi! <br><b>littleSquirrel</b>: Hello <br><b>smallRhino</b>: hello! <br><b>smallBear</b>: Hey all, finally people! <br><b>snappyBison</b>: hello. <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: yes finally! <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: So what do you guys think? <br><b>littleSquirrel</b>: What's everyone first impression <br><b>snappyBison</b>: I feel like everyone is the asshole lol. <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: I think the guy is the asshole in this instance <br><b>littleSquirrel</b>: I think this one is tricky because there's some room for cultural miserunderstanding too <br><b>smallRhino</b>: My initial thoughts are that she is not the asshole. <br><b>smallBear</b>: I do think it is a little unreasonable for her to expect her husband to field these calls all the time. It's one thing to pass the phone to him if she's with him and he agrees, but I would also be annoyed to get calls directly about it. <br><b>smallRhino</b>: I would be annoyed too, but I do think you marry into someone's family when you marry them <br><b>smallBear</b>: I get that very close-knit families of any culture would expect to always help out family, but marrying into it doesn't always bring that same kind of obligation <br><b>snappyBison</b>: Sure, but there has to be a limit. <br><b>snappyBison</b>: At what point is the husband justified in refusing to translate any more? <br><b>smallRhino</b>: That's true-- I guess it would help to know how often the family is actually bothering him.  <br><b>littleSquirrel</b>: It does seem like she just assumed he would help - I wonder if that had a conversation where she shared what it felt like growing up if it would help  <br><b>smallBear</b>: I think ideally they would stop calling him directly and she would ask each time she gets a call and is busy if he doesn't mind helping. <br><b>smallRhino</b>: I feel like 1-2 times a week is justified, but if it is everyday I think that would be a lot. <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: Agree to the points above, its hard to expect the husband to always take the call and for the wife to not even screen <br><b>snappyBison</b>: and shouldn't the wife understand / be willing to take his feelings into consideration? <br><b>littleSquirrel</b>: Translating can take a lot of mental energy too, it's not a quick thing <br><b>smallBear</b>: I also don't know how ""less busy"" the husband is - sometimes people with very physically busy jobs assume someone with mentally tasking jobs are ""less busy"". <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: They should just set filters and the wife should be more considerate about how the husband feels <br><b>snappyBison</b>: Agreed <br><b>smallRhino</b>: very true-- I guess we don't really know the true circumstances, either.  <br><b>littleSquirrel</b>: They could just hire people too to help translate <br><b>littleSquirrel</b>: Might be a compromise somewhere <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: Or refer them to Google translate <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: haha or Alexa <br><b>smallBear</b>: I think we have to agree yes or no if she is the asshole though. <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: she is the asshole IMO <br><b>snappyBison</b>: Well i feel like even though we're just being presented with the wife's side, we still feel like the husband is sort of justified <br><b>smallBear</b>: Yes there are many apps for on-the-go voice translating now! <br><b>snappyBison</b>: so that makes her the asshole i think, no? <br><b>littleSquirrel</b>: I don't think she's the asshole <br><b>smallBear</b>: Using an app would do the same purpose as calling the husband <br><b>snappyBison</b>: idk, im with spryOrangutan i think she's the asshole <br><b>smallRhino</b>: I kind of think she is too <br><b>smallBear</b>: I agree she is the asshole here, there has to be compromise. <br><b>smallRhino</b>: I'd like to know how many times he is being called though.  <br><b>littleSquirrel</b>: Yeah but I guess if we think shes the asshole then does 2 times a week versus 5 really matter <br><b>smallRhino</b>: And she should still talk to her parents and ask them to call her first or send a text or something so it's more manageable.  <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: yeah. there are a lot of details to consider but unfortunately, we can only go by what is in the text. Agree with shooting the quick text even before the call, the wife may not even know how much calls the husband is getting <br><b>snappyBison</b>: I think she is the asshole regardless of how many calls the husband is receiving, as it appears she is not taking his feelings into consideration. <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: Im thinking that there would be a reason why suddenly, the husband called the situation into attention when previously it was fine <br>"
6,"<b>conventionalGorilla</b>: hello! <br><b>smallBison</b>: Hey guys. <br><b>spryRabbit</b>: Hello! Nice to have someone to talk to about this <br><b>littleGoat</b>: Hey again some of  you <br><b>spryRabbit</b>: I feel like the guy is the asshole in this instance <br><b>snappyGiraffe</b>: WOW! My first thought is this man is incredibly aggressive and an asshole. I felt very offended  <br><b>smallBison</b>: Interesting case we have here. Initial thoughts? <br><b>spryRabbit</b>: I feel like there could have been other ways to voice his concern and while he may have been polite in talking to his wife's mother about it, it really does seem condescending <br><b>conventionalGorilla</b>: I think he is the asshole too-- I understand that he would want her to learn English, but from the way he spoke he had a very elitist attitude about it that didn't sit well with me. <br><b>smallBison</b>: Really?? I felt like he was not the asshole at all here. He comes across as very angry, but I felt like the way he handled it with the mother in law was not bad. <br><b>snappyGiraffe</b>: I think he has some serious issues with anger and am scared for his wife! What could the other side be? <br><b>littleGoat</b>: So at first, I thought the way he said it was very asshole-ish, but I also know what it's like to vent on social media when the actual conversation was much more polite.  <br><b>smallBison</b>: Yes littleGoat I agree completely, that was my read on the situation as well. <br><b>littleGoat</b>: It doesn't sound like anyone asked him if they could call him during the day to help translate. It sounds like he was trying to at least be helpful instead of just not answering the phone anymore <br><b>conventionalGorilla</b>: I guess it is good that he offered to help her and provided her with a whole host of resources that she could use to learn English, but it came off as very rude and as if he has a superiority complex. <br><b>spryRabbit</b>: I did not particularly like his statement on how easily he can learn several language so he is expecting that learning English would be easy <br><b>smallBison</b>: I felt like he came across as an asshole to us the readers, but that he is actually justified in being frustrated and that he handled the situation very appropriately. <br><b>snappyGiraffe</b>: I think his ""helpfulness"" was just a way to continue being rude and racist  <br><b>smallBison</b>: Eh, if you read how he explained things to the mother in law, it doesnt seem to me like he was being rude or racist. <br><b>spryRabbit</b>: Agree with sna <br><b>spryRabbit</b>: sna <br><b>littleGoat</b>: Right, it's easy for us to call him an asshole based on the language he used in his posting. He could have just ignored them all and refused to help, but he at least tried. His mental judgments are crude to us but he was trying to... <br><b>spryRabbit</b>: snappyGiraffe <br><b>spryRabbit</b>: hahahaha <br><b>littleGoat</b>: ...balance his reaction to being bothered but also trying to solve the problem instead of saying no and refusing to help. <br><b>snappyGiraffe</b>: It is just so hard to see his side because it seems like he's just using the situationas an excuse to let his racism and general frusterations about wife and family spill over <br><b>smallBison</b>: Anyways, so yeah I think the guy's probably an asshole in real life, but in this situation i do not think he was the asshole. <br><b>conventionalGorilla</b>: True-- I think he should have reworded and it isn't necessarily racist to say she should learn English (not that it is an easy thing to do, but she struggled in certain situations and knowing English, regardless of race, would help her) <br><b>smallBison</b>: Gotta vote not the asshole for this one. <br><b>snappyGiraffe</b>: I think he's the asshole, there's too many other ways he could have handled it <br><b>smallBison</b>: such as? <br><b>snappyGiraffe</b>: literally any other way <br><b>smallBison</b>: such as? <br><b>littleGoat</b>: I don't think he is an asshole in this situation, even if he's an asshole on Reddit :) <br><b>spryRabbit</b>: I think if he had some thoughts, he could have said it to his wife so she can mediate or explain to him another side to go about it <br><b>littleGoat</b>: I think they still would have thought he was an asshole if he just refused to help at all. <br><b>snappyGiraffe</b>: Not yell, not use racist language <br><b>smallBison</b>: he didn't use racist language.... <br><b>smallBison</b>: what? <br><b>littleGoat</b>: He didn't in the actual conversation with the MIL. <br><b>snappyGiraffe</b>: ""I told her I'm sick of dealing with her shit because she can't speak english, she's been here for 8 years she should be able to speak english by now"" <br><b>snappyGiraffe</b>: quote from him  <br><b>snappyGiraffe</b>: Why does it matter if someone learns English? <br><b>littleGoat</b>: He later clarified that. <br><b>smallBison</b>: quote from him in his post. not in what he said to her.. <br><b>snappyGiraffe</b>: he said ""I told her"" .... <br><b>smallBison</b>: if you had read his edit at the bottom you'd have seen that. <br><b>snappyGiraffe</b>: Yeah he said that after people had yelled at him <br>"

Unless his mother-in-law has mistreated him, there is no reason he can't help her with simple favors. I think the husband is being petty.

People that are older cant simply learn english. <br><b>smallRabbit</b>: and he may not mean what he said while he was irritated, given that he has been helping for a long time <br><b>newPig</b>: I do think the husband has a point though that they could get an app on the mom's phone to help with translation. Then anything further, she could call about. <br><b>littleDonkey</b>: her husband is supposed to help his inlaw, which is no big deal <br><b>smallRabbit</b>: both parties have to compromise <br><b>smallGorilla</b>: I don't think this person is an asshole, just a little out of touch.

But the husband can help out too. <br><b>smallRabbit</b>: so I don't think they are assholes, but each of them can do a little better to be more considerate <br><b>smallGoat</b>: Nobody is perfect in the situation, but except for the husband's comment, nobody is really a huge asshole <br><b>likelyGiraffe</b>: Its clear they both have expectations. They arent communicating what that is until it builds up <br><b>smallGorilla</b>: Sorry. littleDonkey it sounds like he already does. It just is more often then he wishes.

They spend part of the year in the US, and this appears to be one of a few weekends they spend with their mother. I feel like they could have mediated a conversation between all parties <br><b>conventionalBison</b>: This is a tricky situation. I think of the German husband would simply say that he wants his husband to enjoy time with mom it would be great. <br><b>newCow</b>: Hi guys! This scenario honestly reminds me off myself because I am in a bilingual family. I think this scenario in particular is difficult because more than one person is involved.

They are in a tough position, but need to make their spouse feel comfortable <br><b>newCow</b>: The poster should have told her husband to speak English! English is the common language amongst the three. Even if the husband is uncomfortable he should do it so that the mom is not left out.  <br><b>newRabbit</b>: the husband could have participated in the conversation in english but the mother did not have that option <br><b>likelyPig</b>: He could have spoken to his mother prior to the visit to prep the sitiuation <br><b>spryMonkey</b>: Well, they could explain to their spouse and let them know the situation. Germany might have different social etiquette than america.  <br><b>conventionalRhino</b>: He could express to his husband that he will learn english better with practice <br><b>likelyPig</b>: Over time he would have felt more comfortable speaking German with her.   <br><b>conventionalBison</b>: The mother is the gracious hostess.

I will only limit that his way of solving the situation if he was something idiotic.  <br><b>conventionalLion</b>: I don't think it's a bad idea to help her learn English, but he also can't make her do it. <br><b>conventionalHorse</b>: He said it in respect <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: I am having trouble deciding one way or another. There is nothing wrong with trying to help someone by offering to help them with resources to learn a new language.  <br><b>likelyMonkey</b>: The area at the bottom said that he did not speak to her that way as he did in the post.  <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: However telling someone you are being burdened by then instead of just saying you can't really help them as much anymore feels more like an asshole move.  <br><b>conventionalHorse</b>: So he didn't read the whole thing... <br><b>smallGorilla</b>: He meant well for his mother inlaw but he should be a little bit polite. <br><b>culturedCow</b>: He could simply give her an app on her cell phone that translates everything she says into English <br><b>conventionalHorse</b>: he didn't say that to her  <br><b>youngGiraffe</b>: Yeah, his edit took me from ""definitely the asshole"" to ""I still think he might be"" because of my reasons above. <br><b>conventionalHorse</b>: he was just venting online <br><b>conventionalLion</b>: I think his motives for helping her learn English are pretty selfish too. <br><b>likelyMonkey</b>: Also, considering he learned spanish to better be able to communicate with them, clearly he cares <br><b>conventionalHorse</b>: its not selfish, I wouldn't be able to spend ten minutes on the phone if I were at work  <br><b>culturedCow</b>: I say that his motives are valid but the methods used were not. <br><b>youngGiraffe</b>: True, he has made the effort to communicate with this in-laws and MIL in a language that they are comfortable with. <br><b>conventionalHorse</b>: he was just venting online, and used different motives to explain it to her ' <br><b>likelyMonkey</b>: Well that is why he put an edit section at the bottom, to clarify how he was not rude to her and offered help and resources <br><b>conventionalLion</b>: He doesn't have to answer his phone. It's ok to set boundaries. <br><b>culturedCow</b>: He cannot be her translator for life. <br><b>likelyMonkey</b>: Absolutely agree <br><b>smallGorilla</b>: after considering both side, I have come to the conclusion that he is not an asshole because his motives are valid but he should be a little bit more polite. <br><b>youngGiraffe</b>: I think if he had made it clear he offered to help her, for her convenience, and not made it sound like he was forcing independence from him on her. <br><b>conventionalHorse</b>: if he didn't answer the phone he would catch hell from his wife <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: For him wanting her to stop relying on him as much is a perfectly valid reason but perhaps it was his focus on learning the language of the area that really made him come off as the asshole. <br><b>conventionalHorse</b>: he did make that clear <br><b>conventionalLion</b>: I'm also curious as to why the entire family is mad at him if he was polite. I want to believe he was, but I'm having a hard time. <br><b>youngGiraffe</b>: I think if he had made it clear he offered to help her, for her convenience, and not made it sound like he was forcing independence from him on her, he would not be the asshole. <br><b>conventionalLion</b>: I think he was partly an asshole. I would love to believe otherwise, but I'm not convinced. <br><b>conventionalHorse</b>: this person is not an asshole, she has been here 8 years, it is time to learn the ""main"" language spoken in the country  <br><b>conventionalDonkey</b>: I thin that he did his part in order to help out. He has a heart. He is not a complete asshole. <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: I think he was the asshole because people would always like to think they are polite but come off as anything but that. <br><b>youngGiraffe</b>: I think if he offered to teach his wife Spanish, that would be helpful. They could both serve as interpreters if needed. She should step up to the plate, also. <br><b>conventionalDonkey</b>: A true asshole wouldnt do the things that he did <br>"

I think the wife is just pawning off the duties onto him <br><b>youngGoat</b>: You are not entitled to dictate the time of your family though, not even a spouse <br><b>littlePig</b>: I feel that she expresses her style ""I am productive and he is not, so he should do my family's duties in return"" <br><b>conventionalGorilla</b>: I get that the mother is also his family and there is a duty to help. But helping others kind of falls on the helper's time table.  <br><b>littleMonkey</b>: If the parents need help, they should also be considerate of other people and ask for help when someone is available, right? <br><b>likelyHorse</b>: Men are not resources for throwing around <br><b>newRabbit</b>: I think the husband should be able to accept the responsibility <br><b>youngGoat</b>: I feel the biggest issue here is they are not being grateful and considerate but instead feel entitled because of the family card. There is a lack of respect for the husband.  <br><b>likelyHorse</b>: He can, but he was never asked the responsibility was forced on him <br><b>conventionalGorilla</b>: The husband should help when able. But it is unreasonable to expect him to be able to do so at all hours.  <br><b>littlePig</b>: I consider that he can accept to do it, but as a favor it is not a duty that he must constantly fulfill. <br><b>likelyHorse</b>: I understand the wife's point of view, but she isn't that busy doing a masters <br><b>newRabbit</b>: not withstanding, the husband is still the asshole <br><b>littlePig</b>: I understand her too, but she is being very inconsiderate with her husband's feelings. <br><b>likelyHorse</b>: Why didn't the wife teach them some English since they were here for years  <br><b>likelyHorse</b>: He isn't an asshole, I wouldn't do that either <br><b>littlePig</b>: or buy a device that does translations of what she says. <br><b>littleMonkey</b>: An important part of marriage is helping each other, but it's also communicate needs. They both should be able to talk to each other and come up with a better solution to the problem than blaming each other.  <br><b>likelyHorse</b>: There was no compromise, just the expectation of him, doing it  <br><b>littleMonkey</b>: communicating <br><b>littlePig</b>: oh littleMonkey you are right there <br><b>littleMonkey</b>: I agree. That's why I think she was in the wrong. <br><b>newRabbit</b>: the parents are not young, they are old. they might not even know how to read. <br><b>conventionalGorilla</b>: It feels like the wife is trying to pass on what she feels are her responsibilities on the husband.  <br><b>likelyHorse</b>: She is wrong, and not compromising  <br><b>littlePig</b>: yeah <br>"

After completle reading it he does have it opinion on helping. A person is allowed to get frustrated. Maybe him not helping  would allow her to be less dependent and learn more english. <br><b>littlePig</b>: I don't think this person is an asshole. It's not his responsibility to stand by and help his mother in law at random times of the day. it does not make him a racist. Definitely could have been a little more polite.  <br><b>smallCow</b>: I have mixed feelings about this scenario.  If he was really polite, I don't see a problem.  But his language and attitude bother me. <br><b>conventionalHippo</b>: he mother in-law is disrupting his daily life and it was good that he was honest with her respectfully. <br><b>sprySquirrel</b>: Learning a language is extremely hard for some people. Not everyone learns the same or at the same pace so him saying that to his MIL is inconsiderate. He's an asshole for thinking his feelings are ok but he was polite about the situation. <br><b>conventionalHippo</b>: The edit said that he did not use the words ""i'm sick of this shit"" and he said he tried to be polite <br><b>snappyGiraffe</b>: His language and attitude were irksome but when he adjusted his original writing to reflect his views more accurately it didn't seem like an asshole to me. <br><b>spryOrangutan</b>: I had mixed feelings about this scenario too. It would help if he or another family member would personally help her try to learn some parts of the language to help with every day tasks. She may not be comfortable going to ESL classes  <br><b>littlePig</b>: I agree, he should provide some more hands on assistance to help her learn instead of suggesting apps and classes. <br><b>sprySquirrel</b>: I think the way he went about it is okay since he was polite, but he needs to re-think about his mother in law's position. <br><b>snappyGiraffe</b>: He offered to help from what I read.  He wants to help once instead of being relied upon forever. <br><b>conventionalHippo</b>: That's true. And the fact that she has been in the US for 8 years may suggest that she tried to learn English but did not succeed. <br><b>smallCow</b>: So we agree that he was justified in what he felt, and he tried to be polite.  So was he an asshole? <br><b>conventionalHippo</b>: I dont think he was an asshole <br><b>littlePig</b>: No, I do not think he was an asshole. <br><b>smallCow</b>: Okay, I'll say he was not an asshole. <br><b>sprySquirrel</b>: I think he's an asshole for not being considerate ENOUGH.

And if he is getting all upset about doing it, she should not make him. <br><b>snappyBear</b>: She is not an asshole. I believe the husband is definitely more of an asshole than she is. He should be able to help out, it's his family too.  <br><b>culturedRhino</b>: He should share her values as her husband, and he should help her family when she is too busy. <br><b>spryHorse</b>: I agree that they should try to learn the language but it is not as easy as it is made out to be even with those language learning resources <br><b>conventionalLion</b>: She is not an asshole because she is completely right about this whole situation regarding the fact that her parents are immigrants and have worked really hard for her. <br><b>snappyBear</b>: Definitely not easy to learn a language and especially at an older age.  <br><b>culturedRhino</b>: He had the privledge to learn the language in school when it is exponentially easier than as an adult. Now, he is unreasonably asking that they learn what he learned without the same resources. <br><b>conventionalLion</b>: Learning languages is not easy specially at an older age. And when you are constantly working there is barely any time to practice a new language. <br><b>niceHippo</b>: They should speak English at home, instead of always going to Spanish. <br><b>spryHorse</b>: Maybe if she had more time on her hands and just didnt want to be responsible for translating so she dropped it on her husband, then she would seem more like an asshole. but this was not the case <br><b>snappyBear</b>: You should always lend a helping hand to family when you are able to.  <br><b>culturedRhino</b>: She is not the asshole for asking her husband to occasionally help her mother. <br><b>conventionalLion</b>: The husband should be grateful that his wife's parents were even able to come to this country in the first place since they migrated. <br><b>niceHippo</b>: I still have mixed feelings about this.  But I'll concede, she is not trying to be an asshole.   <br><b>conventionalLion</b>: She's not an asshole. <br><b>snappyBear</b>: Not the asshole.

My mother in law expects my husband and his siblings to just drop everything and do what she says  <br><b>youngDonkey</b>: I dont think him as racist also. <br><b>culturedHippo</b>: My first impression is that this guy is an asshole.

So that's why he went upstairs to save the rest of the conservation for later. <br><b>newSquirrel</b>: I think it is just easier for the husband to continue speaking French and may not know how to express what he wants to say in English. <br><b>smallGiraffe</b>: I think the son and his friends should speak in a language that his mother understands when she is around.

He stated he made a choice to basically exclude his mother. He should have compromised.  Spoke English some, German some. Instead, he's an asshole.  <br><b>likelyGorilla</b>: I think it's unfair that they sit and speak in German when the husband can speak English. <br><b>spryCow</b>: I do agree with the person not being an asshole.

Everyone is a bit of an asshole here. <br><b>likelyGorilla</b>: I don't think it's fair to say that just because he's uncomfortable speaking English he shouldn't. Is it fair that the mother is now uncomfortable being excluded in conversations? <br><b>spryCow</b>: On the other hand, I think everyone is being a bit of an asshole in this situation <br><b>culturedPig</b>: He shouldn't have to speak only English but should make more of an effort.  As should the MIL. <br><b>likelyGorilla</b>: I agree that everyone is kind of an asshole here. I do think the son is more so because he basically sacrificed his mother's comfort for his spouse's.

The mother does not need to be in every conversation that her son has. <br><b>niceLion</b>: Like you said they are there for a short time, Why should they change thier primary means of communication just to include her? <br><b>culturedPig</b>: That's why having this be a binary thing is not great. <br><b>culturedPig</b>: No room for nuance in the polls. <br><b>conventionalPanda</b>: true culturedPig <br><b>spryCow</b>: I agree culturedPig <br><b>likelyGorilla</b>: He stated he has spoken mainly in German since he's been there. I'm not saying she has to be in every conversation but to exclude her from most conversations isn't right. <br><b>conventionalPanda</b>: Like in most things, there is blame to go around but the son is the bigger asshole because he is too inflexible and inconsiderate of ALL concerned.  <br><b>niceLion</b>: Do all the convos require her? He seems to be speaking in English when involing her, and German when its just the two of them talking to each other. Just because shes in the room doesn't mean she needs to be involved <br><b>likelyGorilla</b>: I agree with conventionalPanda I think the son needs to think about his mother also. Clearly he's spoken in German quite a lot if she's bothered by it enough to bring it up. <br><b>culturedPig</b>: I think the opposite.

I agree, but they should have made an effort to include her and they were in an English speaking country <br><b>snappyGoat</b>: I think that since his husband is a guest in a foreign country, everyone should be a little more accommodating. <br><b>snappyHippo</b>: Considering his mother was willing to host them, I think it is fair that they spoke English in front of her and German when they were alone together.  <br><b>niceDonkey</b>: She seemed to have spoken to both, she may have spoken in German a bit more, but her husband is new in her life and is likely uncomfortable in that situation. <br><b>sprySquirrel</b>: I don't think the onus is on her to accomodate her Mother, she must please with person with whom she is sleeping, her Mother and she can have separate time to themselves. <br><b>spryWolf</b>: Her mom was nice enough to have them over as guests for the weekend.

It may be hard for them all to participate in a conversation, but at least they could translate and work something out  <br><b>snappyGoat</b>: The mother, as the host, should care about her son enough to be okay with him wanting to make his husband comfortable. <br><b>niceDonkey</b>: I do think that since her mother hosted them as guests, she should have included her in the conversation frequently. <br><b>snappyHippo</b>: It's not that the husband did not speak English, he was just uncomfortable with it, but practicing it is what would make him more comfortable with it and this is the perfect opportunity for that. <br><b>spryWolf</b>: Oh yeah right, this was a HE not a SHE sorry <br><b>smallRabbit</b>: No worries, I had to read that twice too. <br><b>sprySquirrel</b>: Get the Mother to learn German, learning a new language at an older age is a good way to stave off Alzheimers. <br><b>niceDonkey</b>: As long as she would have let her mother know the situation, I think all parties could understand. <br><b>conventionalBear</b>: I think the son (not the woman, oops) should be trying harder to include his mother.

We help them anyway though, if we can. I'm talking stuff like tech support or legal documents. <br><b>culturedGoat</b>: I feel like the person is the asshole because he is the buffer between his parents and his spouse.

However, to me, this is something the wife should have handled as the middle-man and the husband should never have had to handle it. <br><b>culturedGorilla</b>: I would not like it if I was being constantly asked to do translations. <br><b>niceHippo</b>: The way he phrased his writing made him sound like an asshole, but he treated his MIL with respect if he really did tell her so in a respectful manner. <br><b>likelyRhino</b>: As someone who struggles with learning other languages I think this guy is being really unfair in that regard. <br><b>likelyPig</b>: In general, I don’t think he’s an asshole for not wanting to be a translator.  <br><b>youngSquirrel</b>: This is a tough one.

I don't think that is privileged. <br><b>spryMonkey</b>: I can empathize with this guy as it's irritating dealing with other families issues, but she only contacts him when she can't get anyone else. He also doesn't tak into account different things are harder or easier for other people.  <br><b>smallOrangutan</b>: If I moved to another country and only knew a few people who could translate for me, I would want to do everything I could to be able to feel comfortable with the language on my own and be independent. <br><b>likelyRhino</b>: While trying to survive in that country and support a family? <br><b>culturedGorilla</b>: It's not bad to ask for help, but the MIL should be trying to learn. <br><b>likelyPig</b>: He’s not saying don’t call me.

OP could have definitely told their mother in law in a more gentle way, but OP is still right. Mother in law can't depend on everyone around her forever. <br><b>sprySquirrel</b>: it sounded like he was the person she called last, so it cant have really been that often too <br><b>smallRhino</b>: If he does now want to translate for her, he should make himself unavailable but the way he tells the story shows that he does not want to help her. <br><b>spryHorse</b>: I think he's frustrated and after 8 years. <br><b>youngBison</b>: He is the asshole, don’t have to translate if you don’t want... but you don’t get to tell her what to learn <br><b>smallRhino</b>: I think he would be impatient helping her learn English and it would not work even if he wanted to do it. I just think he doesn't want to be bothered. <br><b>sprySquirrel</b>: yeah <br><b>spryHorse</b>: It's for her own good, what if she has an emergency and can't communicate with medical personnel? Some hospitals have people that can translate, but some don't. <br><b>smallRhino</b>: She should learn it but you can't make her. <br><b>newMonkey</b>: I do not think he is an asshole because he tried to help her with resources to help her learn English on her own in a very nice way. It can be very annoying to be randomly be receiving random phone calls to translate for the grandmother.  <br><b>smallRhino</b>: It is her choice. <br><b>youngPanda</b>: It's definitely not the best way to tell her about it, but his feelings are valid. Not everyone can cater to your language needs 24/7 <br><b>spryHorse</b>: It sounds like she has refused to learn at all.

He should have had a discussion with the family. <br><b>smallRhino</b>: He comes across as annoyed but it is not his responsibility to teach her. <br><b>smallRhino</b>: Yes, the family should help as a group. <br><b>youngPanda</b>: If she really wants a constant translator around, she could hire one.

Could be an in-law issue. <br><b>youngBison</b>: It is her choice to learn it or not.  Like it is his to translate or not.  He would not be an asshole for making the choice to not translate.  It seems as if he came off like her was trying to tell her she had to learn it. <br><b>newMonkey</b>: Exactly it sounds like she just wants to be lazy and not put in the effort to learn because she has these people to help her always.

Everyone is busy, but it sounds like the translation burden has been increasing for her husband. <br><b>newBison</b>: There is a fundamental clash of cultures here. He does not respect her culture and she has expectations for him based on her culture that may be unfair to him. <br><b>culturedHippo</b>: I agree with that <br><b>smallSquirrel</b>: Same <br><b>culturedHippo</b>: Although I can't decide if theyre both the asshole, or neither is the asshole <br><b>newBison</b>: Both are. This marriage is in trouble. <br><b>culturedPanda</b>: It has to be difficult, because he's not just translating but also having to explain the material to them. That could really wear on you after awhile, especially for years. <br><b>niceGoat</b>: I think she is kind of an asshole if she expects him to do it all the time. He should be expected to help out sometimes if its not consistent but like another person said here she should not decide what her husband should do with his time. <br><b>newBison</b>: He married into this. <br><b>culturedHorse</b>: Well, this sounds like unanimous assholes based on forced translation expectations. <br><b>niceGoat</b>: Plus it sounds like she has siblings since she is the oldest why dont they help? <br><b>culturedHorse</b>: Unless, there was a prenup on translations while working full time and in school. <br><b>newBison</b>: Yes!

What if an emergency happens? <br><b>newBison</b>: She doesn't and is ugly about his views.

But if you are going to visit a foreign country you should at least try to learn the language before you go.

She could have interpreted for her husband. <br><b>likelyRhino</b>: She should consider the fact that her mother is being generous and letting her and her husband stay at her home and feeding them. Her mom only has a simple wish which is to feel included, so she should just do that.  <br><b>littleWolf</b>: Some rounds will be done in a GROUP, and others will be done BY YOURSELF. <br><b>sprySquirrel</b>: Do you think he is an asshole for speaking German? <br><b>likelyGiraffe</b>: he says he hates that he sometimes doesn't know the right words.

He also did mention that he has difficulty with speaking or knowing some words. <br><b>sprySquirrel</b>: I think he needs to do a little of both, since his husband understands English <br><b>spryHorse</b>: He was being disrespectful to her parents and she was accomidating that behavior.

They have made decisions within their marriage about the language they wish to use. <br><b>spryRabbit</b>: The husband doesn't feel comfortable speaking English.

Doesn't it? <br><b>newBear</b>: likelyRhino - I agree <br><b>spryRabbit</b>: Common ground: just tell the mother he's not comfortable and ask if it's ok to speak German to him, be a translator and maybe when he is comfortable he will try to open up more. <br><b>likelyGiraffe</b>: we're now at my mother's house <br><b>conventionalHippo</b>: I think he has the right to choose the language that best suits his adult relationship.

Back to the mother, and so on <br><b>spryHorse</b>: The daughter is the key to this whole thing though. She is fluent in both languages. She and her husband really should accomodate their hosts - the parents. <br><b>snappyGoat</b>: I think this is very rude to the mother, and unfair. <br><b>conventionalHippo</b>: I think hashing it out is the best.

The mother does not speak French. They are speaking French in front of her, and being extremely rude.

Instead of addressing the situation, he walked away. He was in wrong in the beginning and walked away so he wouldn't have to face the topic <br><b>likelyOrangutan</b>: Yes I agree. both were rude to leave her there. It's definitely the husband who is trying to make a competition of affection the son. <br><b>culturedRhino</b>: I suppose that does cast some shade.  But, not enough to be disrespected.  <br><b>conventionalBear</b>: I see absolutely nothing here that says the mom is an asshole. <br><b>smallGorilla</b>: The mother is not an asshole because she was voicing her opinion and expressing how she felt, they might have just taken it offesnively. <br><b>youngHippo</b>: It's legitimate to switch to a universal language - they are allowed to say some stuff in French, and of course in private, but in this case in the living room, they should been a little more inclusive, even 50%-50% would've been OK <br><b>spryMonkey</b>: It could be miscommunication in how expectations were met <br><b>culturedRhino</b>: As mom claimes she was nice about it she is not really the ass hole.  <br><b>newSquirrel</b>: Could ut finish <br><b>newSquirrel</b>: could it finish <br><b>culturedRhino</b>: Yes, it could be a miscommunication so perhaps a discussion should happen,  But that does not make her an ass hole.  <br><b>conventionalBear</b>: I disagree with the 50-50, at least when they are all sitting together.

Sometimes you just need to speak privately.

It is obvious the family takes the position of taking care of the MIL. <br><b>conventionalGoat</b>: My thoughts are that he was not the asshole. I thought that he was just frustrated. It seems he has been helping her for a while. Its a shame everyone is mad at him.  <br><b>newHippo</b>: He knew all of these facts when he married his wife, and was accepting of them.  Sure it may be annoying, but we do things we don't necessarily want to for family. <br><b>newMonkey</b>: isn't helping her to learn a way of taking care of her? <br><b>newHippo</b>: He lashed out in frustration and that makes him the asshole. <br><b>youngSquirrel</b>: Not everyone is good at languages. The older you get the harder it is. <br><b>snappyBear</b>: I'm having trouble deciding, but I'm feeling like he is a bit of an asshole for simply making his mother-in-law feel lesser, even if his intentions were good. <br><b>newHippo</b>: Proposing it slowly over time in a calm, and respectful manner with the support of his wife, since it is her family would have potentially solved the issue. <br><b>newMonkey</b>: but isn't 8 years long enough to at least learn basic English <br><b>conventionalGoat</b>: Maybe he did lash out. I can see where that would hurt his mother-in-law.  <br><b>smallHorse</b>: Personally I wouldn't want to have to ask someone to take me everywhere, I think she enjoys being catered to <br><b>youngSquirrel</b>: Not if that was never the intention.

And probably some generational differences too. <br><b>smallSquirrel</b>: I think she's an asshole for not having the conversation with her husband and her mother and instead posting about it on the internet. <br><b>conventionalBison</b>: It also seems like he is telling her that he is frustrtrated and had enough. She is minimizing his concerns.  <br><b>smallOrangutan</b>: Moving toward resolution rather than placing blame would probably be the better move. <br><b>spryPig</b>: she should have asked him if he minded in the first place <br><b>smallSquirrel</b>: Kudos to her for getting her master's an being busy, but that doesn't make her mother his responsibility.

He can't be there all the time for them. <br><b>littlePanda</b>: I do not think he is an asshole. It can get frustrating when someone asks you for help with the same thing over and over, when the person could take it on themselves to at least try. <br><b>youngBison</b>: If he had been more polite in his explanation, I would agree with him. However, he had a meltdown and looks like an ass. <br><b>culturedRhino</b>: You would have a meltdown too if you were pushed to your breaking point <br><b>littlePanda</b>: I think he was frustrated when he wrote the post. He explained at the bottom that he talked to her in a respectful manner. <br><b>niceMonkey</b>: his TLDR clarified that his tone was respectful to the parents.  It was his write up that wasn't respectful, and I agree with you guys on that aspect. <br><b>niceMonkey</b>:   However, if what we read was true, he wasn't an asshole at all explaining to the parents. <br><b>youngBison</b>: He should have made his case with more class. He married into the family and knew what he was getting into. He should at least be respectful to his in-laws  <br><b>youngBison</b>: in bringing this up. <br><b>niceMonkey</b>: Again, it seems like he was respectful to the in laws. <br><b>likelyOrangutan</b>: The parents may not have as strong an appitude to learn another language as he himself does - thats a limitation of the parents and maybe he needs to understand their limitations or what they feel comfortable doing. <br><b>culturedRhino</b>: He doesn't feel comfortable continuing to be their translator either and they need to understand that as well <br><b>niceMonkey</b>: The main point is that he shouldn't be expected to be a translator, and he has provided tools so that the parents could learn.  If you decide to move to, say, Germany, it's your prerogative to learn German. <br><b>youngBison</b>: "" I told her I'm sick of dealing with her shit because she can't speak english"" - that's not being polite.  <br><b>culturedRhino</b>: and he said at the bottom he didn't use that verbatim  <br><b>likelyOrangutan</b>: The post also pointed out there is no official language <br><b>youngBison</b>: I agree he is right with his feelings, but his tone and being hostile was over the top. <br><b>niceMonkey</b>: youngBison if you read the entire prompt, or listened to what we were saying, you would have known that he didn't say that. <br><b>littlePanda</b>: I think he was more saying what he wanted to say to her in his head.

I do not see how it is disrespectful.  <br><b>openCamel</b>: I had the same initial impression. It sounded like the guy just isn't that comfortable speaking English, so I doubt they're doing it to exclude anyone. <br><b>livelyDolphin</b>: This person is completely an asshole.

Even when someone speaks a second language, it can be mentally exhausting to switch all the time--and yes, it's quite jingoistic to insist that her son and his husband speak only English around her. <br><b>delightedOtter</b>: She should not be offended. But should try to understand and learn some from him <br><b>livelyDolphin</b>: Right. There's no way that he'd even have a regular conversation with her because they don't speak the same language. She can't even be included though her nosey ass wants it <br><b>brightHorse</b>: I understand that she might want to participate in a conversation with her son and his partner but I think the way she went about it was probably not the best. <br><b>eagerBear</b>: She came across as a busybody and nosey. I don't know if there are racist undertones in that particular example, but it is certainly rude of her to assume she's automatically privy to everyone else's conversation. <br><b>lightMonkey</b>: Furthermore, it struck me as a red flag that she first called her son's husband his ""partner"" and only later clarified that they're married. <br><b>livelyDolphin</b>: I just assume if you're a nationalist you're a racist <br><b>fulfilledGorilla</b>: This person is an asshole and nosey.

Maybe she should learn French and also learn to respect others more. <br><b>eagerBear</b>: If we had to consider both sides, I can see how it can feel a little isolating to be next to two people involved in a conversation you have no access to. That happens to me and my husband's family. <br><b>eagerBear</b>: Only in the sense that she isn't able to even ""jump in"" and contribute if she had something relevant to add. <br><b>eagerBear</b>: But maybe she should also learn some French.

I voted that the son wasn't the asshole, but I think he could have thought of better ways to include his mother. <br><b>delightedHippo</b>: I don't think this person's the asshole. It sounds like their husband can barely communicate in English, and it said they spoke ""mostly German"", which implies they had spoken in English a fair amount as well. <br><b>inquisitiveGorilla</b>: I think the son is the asshole, as he should have included the mother since it was at her house they were staying at. Just an attempt to link both conversations, through body language. Even drawing pictures may help.  <br><b>fulfilledBear</b>: I do not the OP is the asshole but I don't quite think the mom is being the asshole, either, unless she actually called her own kid an asshole. I think it's just a tough/awkward situation and the OP is trying to make it work. <br><b>novelOtter</b>: The ""mostly"" is a good catch. I think the son could have also repeated important parts of the conversation in English after using German. That would have been beneficial for his mom and for the the husband as well. <br><b>inspiredMonkey</b>: I think the poster was trying to think of both parties but found it difficult to find ways to incorporate his mom. <br><b>brightDolphin</b>: I did not find the op to be an asshole. He husband is just very nervous to be in a new place with his inlaws. I can understand being nervous around your inlaws.  <br><b>livelyHorse</b>: I don't think the person is an asshole, the husband is not comfortable with English, not because he doesn't want to but because he struggles. <br><b>brightDolphin</b>: The mother got angry about it which makes her the asshole. It's okay to say that you miss your son and would like to have some more conversations, it's another thing to get angry that your son is supporting his husband.  <br><b>brightDolphin</b>: the mother is already in a comfortable place, her house, the husband is not so his feelings come first <br><b>inquisitiveGorilla</b>: That is a good point <br><b>novelOtter</b>: Agreed. The son's not an asshole, but he could do more to be inclusive of both parties. <br><b>delightedHippo</b>: I agree with you fulfilledBear I don't think either of them is really an asshole unless the mom came out swinging and called them an asshole lol. If the mom had politely asked to be included, then I don't even see this as a big deal.  <br><b>fulfilledBear</b>: Agreed with brightDolphin; the OP's mother is not being very compassionate. She surely has chances to talk with her child one on one and catch up that way. <br><b>inquisitiveGorilla</b>: After seeing both sides, I now think that the son is not the asshole.

I think the OP is doing their best but isn't handling it like an expert, but that doesn't make them the asshole. <br><b>livelyHorse</b>: The mother needs to understand the husband is insecure with his english language. <br><b>novelOtter</b>: I've got some compassion for the mother. I may be in the minority here. <br><b>delightedHippo</b>: I see the mother's side for sure, I just don't think the OP is an ""asshole"" just because they aren't a master mediator.  <br><b>novelOtter</b>: The son has clearly stated that the husband knows English and it seems has a high enough level of fluency but is uncomfortable with it. English is the unifying language amongst all 3. But I still do not think the son's an asshole. <br><b>inspiredMonkey</b>: I voted no.

The post said that the partner KNOWS english just fine, just has an accent and barely spoke english the entire time <br><b>excitedHorse</b>: We can be asked to speak English properly <br><b>lightGiraffe</b>: It's her house and they should be a bit more respectful. I wouldn't say they were disrespectful completely, they just weren't being thoughtful at all. <br><b>brightOtter</b>: exacly. it would be different if he couldn't speak english <br><b>livelyZebra</b>: I agree that they should try to speak some English at least during some parts of the day like lunch or dinner. <br><b>novelHippo</b>: If they were teenagers it would make sense but adults should speak together like adults. <br><b>excitedHorse</b>: I agree <br><b>lightGiraffe</b>: for the dude to just get up and walk out IS rude though. <br><b>inspiredDolphin</b>: I'm sure the partner felt really uncomfortable as is and to have his partner's mother point out something she wasn't happy with felt like an attack <br><b>inspiredDolphin</b>: Language barriers are always hard <br><b>brightOtter</b>: yes that was rude  <br><b>delightedCamel</b>: I agree <br><b>novelHippo</b>: It's hard to know how it was delivered too.  Was it a polite what are you talking about? <br><b>lightGiraffe</b>: The partner is 20.. that was pure disrespect. If that happened in his parent's home, they would have no problem calling them out for speaking English over french <br><b>excitedHorse</b>: It is not right to insult <br><b>livelyZebra</b>: But I don't know why she immediately assumes that they are doing it to exclude her and disrespect her. I think she could have just asked: ""Hey, what are y'all talking about?"" Maybe they were talking about some funny joke in French... <br><b>brightOtter</b>: i understand that it mightve felt like an attack too though, but he couldve understood instead of feeling like that  <br><b>livelyZebra</b>: There was a way for everyone involved to be more thoughtful <br><b>lightGiraffe</b>: But that's how it feels when someone is doing something that they know you can't do and don't even try to include you <br><b>excitedHorse</b>:  You have to learn the language of the living country <br><b>lightGiraffe</b>: Especially for languages, more so. <br><b>delightedCamel</b>: I think she could have been more thoughtful, but I think the son and his partner should include her <br><b>novelHippo</b>: Family dynamics are so tricky too.  So much baggage sometimes.   <br><b>brightOtter</b>: i don't think they should be speaking french at all though epecially since he can speak english perfectly fine <br><b>inspiredDolphin</b>: I definitely agree that there's fault on both side.

Fault on both sides. <br><b>brightOtter</b>: she should have been more tactful <br><b>novelHippo</b>: If they want to speak french in the bedroom more power to them but maybe not in front of mom. <br><b>brightOtter</b>: yes but it's HER house <br><b>lightGiraffe</b>: From experience, the French aren't that nice to those who speak English over French in their country and they will flat out ignore you  <br><b>inspiredDolphin</b>: The situation sucks and wasn't handled super well, but I don't think she was an asshole for feeling that way <br><b>brightOtter</b>: i would feel disrespected if people were speaking in a different language if i had invited them over to hang out <br><b>lightGiraffe</b>: I think she just wanted to be able to talk to them and communicate and feel like she's still a part of her son's life instead of being an outsider in her own home <br><b>novelHippo</b>: It's hard when it's such a short time too.   <br><b>excitedHorse</b>: It is not right to insult him  <br><b>lightGiraffe</b>: I've had friends do the same to me and it's not a good feeling when someone is laughing and joking in your face in another language, knowing you don't speak it <br><b>brightOtter</b>: no but they were insulting her too?  <br><b>brightOtter</b>: it's not a good feeling at all <br><b>lightGiraffe</b>: I doubt they were insulting her, but that's not the point <br><b>excitedHorse</b>: yes <br><b>livelyZebra</b>: They probably were not, but she could have just asked what they were talking about <br><b>brightOtter</b>: I'm meaning that they were disrespecting her <br><b>livelyZebra</b>: instead of immediately telling them they were being disrespectful <br><b>delightedCamel</b>: I agree, I don't think anyone was the asshole in this situation  <br><b>inspiredDolphin</b>: Yeah I feel bad for everyone.

He is not an asshole; he simply vented in the beginning of the passage <br><b>inspiredDolphin</b>: He seems to have an off putting personality. but I did not think the question made him an asshole.

They have a completely different life than a lot of people can imagine being immigrants. They have difficulties others don't face. <br><b>inquisitiveHorse</b>: I may ask her if I can get back to her later, but I wouldn't pawn her off on someone else without their consent <br><b>lightGiraffe</b>: I agree <br><b>openBear</b>: I think setting clear boundaries would help this situation out, but I don't think she was being an asshole by asking. <br><b>brightCamel</b>: Yeah, that's a good point. I missed that the expectation of help ALWAYS being on him could get pretty old after a while <br><b>excitedMonkey</b>: true, but she does make a good point about marriage responsibilites  <br><b>fulfilledDolphin</b>: I don't think the person didn't consent...he put himself in the situation by ""bridging the culture"" <br><b>excitedMonkey</b>: he did say ""I do"" <br><b>eagerZebra</b>: so, not the a**hole, but needing to communicate? <br><b>lightGiraffe</b>: He didn’t say that he was goi g to be a full time translator tho. <br><b>excitedMonkey</b>: yes <br><b>lightGiraffe</b>: Just a husband  <br><b>fulfilledDolphin</b>: He isn;t a full time translator... it didnt say that <br><b>fulfilledDolphin</b>: it says she calls him when she has problems <br><b>fulfilledDolphin</b>: that seems pretty reasonable <br><b>inquisitiveHorse</b>: Yes, marrying someone does not mean you agree to take on that person's responsibilities, big or small. <br><b>lightGiraffe</b>: How can she get mad at him when she’s not fully helping herself ?  <br><b>eagerZebra</b>: There was a point earlier asking about the frequency of the calls <br><b>brightCamel</b>: I agree with other inquisitiveHorse <br><b>inquisitiveHorse</b>: She is a very small asshole for not clearing it with her husband first. <br><b>openBear</b>: If he feels like it is too frequent, that's a conversation he needs to have.

The husband may be able to help but it shouldn't be the default without her asking. I think she is being an asshole to assume. <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: It sounds like she could make more of an effort to help with translation duties, but at the same time I can see where she's in school and busy, and her husband speaks the language and has more free time.   <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: Some sort of compromise should have been reached by now. <br><b>openBear</b>: Well. I think she is the asshole. If it's complex enough that google translate isn't working well enough, then it's a decent undertaking <br><b>novelMonkey</b>: her parents should have learned English by now. She could have even taught them. it's not her husband's job.  <br><b>openBear</b>: . I think he should be willing to do it every so often, but if he started out fine with it, and now has changed, then it must be a decent amount of work. <br><b>lightCamel</b>: I think she is kinda of an asshole because her translating all these years has enabled her parants to not learn english <br><b>lightCamel</b>: He is also an asshole for not being nicer about it <br><b>curiousOtter</b>: yeah, I agree with  that.

She should put some effort in for her own parents <br><b>fulfilledDolphin</b>: I don't think she is an asshole for expecting her husband to help out <br><b>novelMonkey</b>: help out every now and then but not so much that it's frequently a bother.  <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: About learning English, if anyone has learned a second language, you know how hard it can be to learn complex terminology. I'm all for immigrants learning English, but… <br><b>openBear</b>: My girlfriend is Ukranian, and sometimes I have to help her parents translate stuff from Ukranian into English. If OP's parents are anything like my girlfriend's, it's a pretty big amount of work <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: …even after years they may not know legal terms and things like that <br><b>delightedBison</b>: I agree that it's difficult for the parents to learn English, and that someone helping with translation is valid. But that doesn't mean it should always be the husband. <br><b>openBear</b>: livelyHippo agreed, the work must be decently complex in the post, because otherwise you'd just use google translate <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: True <br><b>lightCamel</b>: Yes i agree that  translating legal documents is something he should be able to help with but menus is kind of excessive <br><b>fulfilledDolphin</b>: Where it not for her studies I'm sure she would have accepted taking the job away from the husband since he considers it to be too much <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: Interesting that even if we differ in whether she's an asshole, we all seem to see all sides of the issue, at least. <br><b>novelMonkey</b>: I have helped people whose native language wasn't English. the parents didn't even try to learn English and relied on the kids to translate. it can be trying. <br><b>curiousOtter</b>: That is where the communication should come in though <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: cur <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: D'oh.  curiousOtter is right.  These two need to communiate more. <br><b>lightCamel</b>: I have helped my in-laws alot so i really have no sypathy for him or her <br><b>fulfilledDolphin</b>: no she is not an asshole because he is part of the family <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: I'm struggling to learn a second language (Japanese) and so I have sympathy for the metal exhaustion translating must cause. It can't be easy. <br><b>openBear</b>: Lastly, I think that asshole is a hard word for her, but to make it short, I think he has the right to say no to translating <br><b>novelMonkey</b>: either way would be difficult and cultural differences should be kept in mind <br>"

Like is the family even trying? <br><b>fulfilledMonkey</b>: He comes across as a jerk even in his online posts. <br><b>inquisitiveGorilla</b>: the parants should not be putting the burden on the entire family. the wife should not be pushing it on her husband and he should just not answer like the rest of the family probably does <br><b>delightedZebra</b>: I totally agree he is an asshole. How can you be that harsh on an older lady. Mind you it's much easier to learn especially another language when young <br><b>lightOtter</b>: He shouldn't have to translate, but he shouldn't force he parents to learn English <br><b>excitedCamel</b>: I think this person was right in encouraging his MIL to become more independent in learning English and not rely on him several times a day for translations. The MIL has been in the country long enough to speak basic English <br><b>openHippo</b>: He's an asshole for many reasons, but first on my list is this assumption that because he learned a few languages quickly, that anyone can. Not all of us are that smart. <br><b>inquisitiveGorilla</b>: he could also try and teach them some english if he has the time <br><b>openHippo</b>: And as delightedZebra noted, she's older and therefore it's going to be harder to learn. <br><b>lightOtter</b>: Also, we've gotta note the edit where he clarified that he tried to be respectful instead of saying  <br><b>fulfilledMonkey</b>: The problem is he doesn't sound very encouraging at all. He comes across as very negative <br><b>delightedZebra</b>: He is not considerate in my opinion because of the age gap, what if she has some learning deficiencies.  <br><b>livelyGiraffe</b>: Right, people who speak english dont understand how hard it is for others to learn <br><b>openHippo</b>: English is such a difficult language, I am sympathetic to anyone trying to learn it. I'm a native speaker and even I get tripped up regularly. <br><b>excitedCamel</b>: The MIL may be older but not incapable of learning a new language. That's just an excuse.  <br><b>lightOtter</b>: I don't think he has to be a translator, but learning a new language is a daunting task, no matter how much you're surrounded by it.  <br><b>fulfilledMonkey</b>: In the edit he also swore at everyone <br><b>openHippo</b>: I'm not saying she's incapable, it's just a slower process. I'm slow-going in learning a new language myself, probably due to my age. It's just such a struggle. <br><b>excitedCamel</b>: He was expressing his frustration in the credit <br><b>lightOtter</b>: Yeah he seems like an asshole to us as well haha <br><b>inquisitiveGorilla</b>: it is hard but it is impossable if you never try and translating all the time doesnt help them learn <br><b>livelyGiraffe</b>: He definately came across terribly <br><b>openHippo</b>: It's funny, if his post had come off less negative and frustrated, he might've changed opinions.  Instead he comes off as an asshole just because of his tone, even if he has some points. <br><b>delightedZebra</b>: I consider him to be an asshole because he is not considerate.  <br><b>livelyGiraffe</b>: Nowadays you can get a translator on a smartphone for simple things <br><b>lightOtter</b>: I think the situation didn't make him an asshole, but the way he seems to have handled it makes him the asshole. <br><b>inquisitiveGorilla</b>: i think everyone in the senario are aholes <br><b>fulfilledMonkey</b>: I agree with openHippo <br><b>fulfilledMonkey</b>: Yes, agreed that it's his handling of the situation that makes him the asshole. He can't express his opinion in a constructive way. <br><b>excitedCamel</b>: His saying he was tired of her shit made him look like the asshole at first until he added to the post.  <br><b>openHippo</b>: Dang. Two minutes left and we are all in agreement. <br><b>lightOtter</b>: If he sounded like he was more doing it out of mutual benefit then I might have seen it differently, but he was doing it solely for himself <br><b>excitedCamel</b>: I'm not.

There are resources out there, apps, etc.  <br><b>excitedHippo</b>: I agree with you there with the independent statement, however I don't think that one word makes him an asshole. <br><b>livelyGiraffe</b>: once in a while is fine but he was being bombarded  <br><b>delightedHorse</b>: I think the family was an asshole for not supporting him lol <br><b>fulfilledDolphin</b>: Regardless, if it is your mother-in-law and you married her daughter you are a lifeline to her. I would do anything to help my mother-in-law.  <br><b>excitedHippo</b>: And he is helping her by giving her the resources to learn an invaluable language. <br><b>livelyGiraffe</b>: Yeah. Once in a while. Not with everything. I can see why he was annoyed.  <br><b>livelyGiraffe</b>: Agree with excitedHippo  <br><b>eagerOtter</b>: I think it's likely the mother won't use those resources however  <br><b>inspiredGorilla</b>: it's an emotional response, he just feels overwhelmed, but what happens when he's not around to help? it would be good for the mother in law to lean on others less <br><b>fulfilledDolphin</b>: One thing to take into consideration is the ability to learn as well. It can be very overwhelming for people that are older and difficult to do.  <br><b>delightedHorse</b>: Yes she seems very stubborn but he was just pretty much venting his frustrations which does not mean he's an asshole, an asshole would be someone who refused to help and called her a nuisance <br><b>livelyGiraffe</b>: eagerOtter of course not. Why would she when she has someone she can run to every time she needs something already ? Being sarcastic btw. And totally agree with you.  <br><b>inspiredGorilla</b>: absolutely, its a delicate issue, very emotional to make big adjustments <br><b>eagerOtter</b>: I think he should have asked for his family to help more <br><b>eagerOtter</b>: I agree that helping all the time like the last situation is too much <br><b>livelyGiraffe</b>: She needs to be more independent  <br><b>fulfilledDolphin</b>: Talking to family would have ben a great choice. Confiding in his wife first and working together to help the situation.  <br><b>eagerOtter</b>: I think it's very unlikely at her age that she will take the time to learn a new language  <br><b>excitedHippo</b>: My overall conclusion is that he is not an asshole. He gave her resources and offered to help her learn something that will really help her and make her less dependent on others. He never insulted her either. <br><b>fulfilledDolphin</b>: He should have talked to his wife about his frustrations and worked with her on a solution instead of making mother-in-law feeling put out.  <br>"
125,"<b>excitedBear</b>: We discuss here <br><b>excitedBear</b>: I will start by saying I do NOT think this person is an asshole. <br><b>brightOtter</b>: Considering the son's partner is capable of speaking English, I think it's inconsiderate to only speak French knowing their mother in law cannot understand.  <br><b>excitedBear</b>: Exactly. I agree <br><b>inspiredBison</b>: Couldn't she have just asked them to speak English? <br><b>excitedBear</b>: They might not have realized it was rude, but I think the fact that he stormed off after she asked them to speak English is an overreaction <br><b>excitedBear</b>: She did <br><b>inquisitiveHorse</b>: This could be written by his father too <br><b>novelCamel</b>: I think the mom is being an asshole.  If they wanted to include her in the conversation then they would speak in English, clearly they didnt want her in the conversation at that time.   <br><b>inspiredBison</b>: He just left the room. That isn't exactly storming off. I think they were just talking naturally and didn't realize it would bother her. <br><b>livelyElephant</b>: It is definitely a rude gesture, but I don't think that he is an asshole.  <br><b>excitedBear</b>: The inlaw is allowing them to stay in their home, presuming for free. If they don't want to include him/her, then speak about whatever that is at another time <br><b>brightOtter</b>: I think the parent probably could have brought up the situation in a nicer way, but they're right in being annoyed by it in my opinion  <br><b>inspiredBison</b>: I agree brightOtter <br><b>brightOtter</b>: The son and his partner could easily just speak French when alone together  <br><b>inquisitiveHorse</b>: Yeah its definitely borderline.  Really depends on the tone and feel of what happened which is hard to guess from the narrative. <br><b>novelCamel</b>: I dont think just because you are allowing someone to stay in your home that it means that they have to be included in every conversation... <br><b>excitedBear</b>: Exactly. And if they're talking about something they don't want to discuss with him/her, it's even more rude tbh <br><b>excitedBear</b>: Including in every conversation is one thing, but if they're constantly in the same room and constantly leaving them out, that's another thing <br><b>livelyElephant</b>: They might have been having a private conversation and did not think about including anyone though.  But he did react a little childish to her calling him out on it. <br><b>inquisitiveHorse</b>: I tend to agree that the parent (mother or father) was unnecessarily left out.  And it leans toward rude on the son and husband's part. <br><b>excitedBear</b>: If it was a one-off situation, sure, but it sounds like this was constant. <br><b>brightOtter</b>: You shouldn't have to be included in every conversation just because you're allowing someone to stay with you, but consideration and common sense should be used. The partner and son are outright excluding the parent completely <br><b>inspiredBison</b>: If this is the normal way that they communicate with each other, then I think it was just natural. I don't think they were intentionally trying to keep her from listening. <br><b>excitedBear</b>: Agreed. I think the overreaction from the partner is uncalled for. <br><b>novelCamel</b>: I think the man was probably just more comfortable speaking his own language and maybe didnt even think anything of it <br><b>livelyElephant</b>: So who are we deciding is an asshole or not?  The mom or the partner? <br><b>excitedBear</b>: I think the son and partner are. <br><b>inspiredBison</b>: While it would be frustrating to not understand them, I don't think I would get mad. I would just ask them to speak English. <br><b>excitedBear</b>: Although barely lol <br><b>inquisitiveHorse</b>: mom or father.  we don't know the gender of the narrator! <br><b>excitedBear</b>: I voted no. <br><b>brightOtter</b>: I don't think the parent is the asshole. If i was staying in someone's home I would make an effort to include them in conversation, and speak in the language they are most comfortable in using as it's their home <br><b>inquisitiveHorse</b>: Same.   <br><b>novelCamel</b>: I voted yes because I think the parent overreacted, there was no ill will <br><b>excitedBear</b>: Yeah, I've been the partner staying with parents. I'm always trying to be respectful and nice. <br><b>livelyElephant</b>: Ok.  So I don't think the parent is an asshole either. <br><b>inspiredBison</b>: I think they weren't thinking about how it looked and just acting naturally. I think the mother could have easily mentioned that she didn't understand. She instead acted rude. I think the mom was the asshole <br>"

I am sure she could reassure him that they wouldn't judge him. <br><b>curiousBear</b>: I do not think that the son is being an asshole but they should have discussed this beforehand. <br><b>novelElephant</b>: She is doing what is best for her and her partner, and that is not being an asshole.  She can catch her mother up at any time in English. <br><b>eagerZebra</b>: Exactly, the scenario does not say he told his mother about his husband's discomfort. <br><b>delightedBison</b>: Yeah, it just doesn't seem like something that should have been an issue, considering it was a previously-addressed issue. <br><b>novelElephant</b>: Or she can translate while they are talking so her mother feels included. <br><b>eagerZebra</b>: If he explained to his mother and she still insists it is a different matter.  But it doesnt say he did. <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: Although I think the child has no ill will towards the mother in this situation, I think they should have just told the mother about the husband being uncomfortable.  <br><b>delightedBison</b>: Yes. Communication is key. <br><b>curiousBear</b>: I understand wanting your partner feeling comfortable being in your parent's house so if they all would have discussed this this would not be an issue at all. <br><b>novelElephant</b>: yes they should have just communicated better <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: It's the difference between someone being uncomfortable vs someone being completely excluded. One is better than the other <br><b>inquisitiveMonkey</b>: If he didn't speak any English I would understand, but he does speak English. I think she would understand if he messed up. <br><b>novelElephant</b>: nobody is being an asshole on purpose <br><b>delightedBison</b>: I I think ""asshole"" is a strong word, but the lack of comminication sorta makes them the ""bad guy"" <br><b>delightedBison</b>: Exactly, no one is being an asshole on purpose. <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: Intent isn't what were debating though either. We're talking about actions  <br><b>eagerZebra</b>: Agreed.  He is the asshole because he just needed to communicate and set expectations instead of letting his mother - who is being kind enough to host them - feel excluded. <br><b>inquisitiveMonkey</b>: To automatically not consider your mother's situation is rude.  <br><b>delightedBison</b>: Actionwise, I guess.yes. Asshole. <br><b>inquisitiveMonkey</b>: I think this could have easily been taken care of if the son talked with his mother and spouse.  <br><b>delightedBison</b>: Yep. And if the spouse really wanted to talk in German, translate for your mother. <br><b>eagerZebra</b>: yep <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: I think if the partner spoke no english it would be more up for debate. But at the end of the day you're completely excluding your parent (whose home you're staying at)  <br><b>delightedBison</b>: She is being nice enough to host and cook. She misses you. Include her. <br><b>curiousBear</b>: I don't think speaking in his partner's native language makes you an asshole.  <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: Exactly, the spouse could help with the whole ""not knowing the right word""  <br><b>inquisitiveMonkey</b>: If they are in a realtionship the mother will never get to know him if they aren't able to communicate.  <br><b>delightedBison</b>: But it's not the mother staying with THEM. She's hosting them and she's being excluded. <br><b>novelElephant</b>: I also think that the parent seems a little insecure and there is a bit of a power struggle going on, but thats just an opinion <br><b>eagerZebra</b>: Possibly, but she is hosting them and they are the guests and they should try to be polite and considerate to her foremost while in her home. <br><b>novelElephant</b>: and maybe thats why that parent is so ""hurt"" about this <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: You're still excluding someone needlessly  <br><b>delightedBison</b>: Yep. Even if he could ONLY speak German, you'd still want to include mom by translating. <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: Is it better to make sure someone is 100% comfortable or exclude someone else completely? Because, for me, exclusion is worse than making someone uncomfortable <br><b>inquisitiveMonkey</b>: It would be hard for the mother to get to know him without communication. Even bad English would help them to get to know each other and feel comfortable.  <br><b>delightedBison</b>: I'll be voting asshole. lol <br><b>livelyHippo</b>: I'll be voting asshole as well  <br><b>eagerZebra</b>: I'm voting asshole as well. <br><b>novelElephant</b>: I'll be voting not asshole <br><b>inquisitiveMonkey</b>: I agree, asshole <br><b>eagerZebra</b>: Unless her cooking is really bad.   <br><b>eagerZebra</b>: Then maybe mom has it coming. <br><b>delightedBison</b>: He's german. What is he judging? hahahah <br><b>curiousBear</b>: I think the more you guys talk about it I will be going with asshole because there are factors that would have fixed. it.  Noncommunication makes him an asshole. <br><b>inquisitiveMonkey</b>: You need to make an effort with your spouses parents. <br><b>novelElephant</b>: everyone is entitle to speak in the language they feel most comfortable <br><b>eagerZebra</b>: as long as it's english. <br><b>inquisitiveMonkey</b>: Their entitled but it's rude <br><b>eagerZebra</b>: (again just kidding) <br>"

He can't just decide he doesn't like doing it anymore because it's annoying him. <br><b>excitedElephant</b>: ir=ts temporary <br><b>fulfilledBear</b>: they are a tea, but there should not be an expectation that he needs to be the translator, she needs to also step up. <br><b>novelGorilla</b>: They could compromise and take turns <br><b>fulfilledBear</b>: i agree <br><b>openGiraffe</b>: Yeah I think they could compromise <br><b>openGiraffe</b>: But I don't think shes an asshole <br><b>fulfilledBear</b>: he needs to have a discussion with her and agree on sharing the responsibility <br><b>excitedElephant</b>: I wonder if she asked him or just expects it.

I would not like to be that dependent upon others. <br><b>openGorilla</b>: It's also different when you're coming from one country to another <br><b>inspiredHorse</b>: He has every right to change that expectation, but he can't dictate what his MIL does. <br><b>livelyGiraffe</b>: It depends on how old she actually is. And still, an effort should be made. <br><b>lightCamel</b>: Yes - I agree she needs to make an effort. <br><b>inspiredHorse</b>: He can only control what he does, like not dropping whatever he's doing to accommodate his MIL.

He sounded very hostile  <br><b>livelyGiraffe</b>: It's hard when the whole family is against you and you've not done anything wrong, really. <br><b>inspiredHorse</b>: The MIL likely doesn't feel the need to learn English, since everyone in her family and neighborhood speaks Spanish. <br><b>lightCamel</b>: It is sad that the whole family has turned against him.   <br><b>curiousZebra</b>: she can learn english by watching English cartoons <br><b>curiousZebra</b>: or they can use translator tool <br><b>lightCamel</b>: I can only imagine the cringe he feels when he sees her number on the phone because he knows she is looking for him to translate. <br><b>novelElephant</b>: Yeah, start with baby steps to learn.

Also, for her being mad that he suggested her parents learn English. <br><b>inspiredDolphin</b>: The woman should know their limits , she is distrubing lot <br><b>novelOtter</b>: She did mention that he does have more free time than her  <br><b>livelyMonkey</b>: Her family is NOT his family; she has more responsibility to them than he does. <br><b>inspiredDolphin</b>: She should use the technology to translate, google translate <br><b>lightGorilla</b>: The expectation that just because he married into the family automatically makes him responsible is alot to put on someone <br><b>eagerGiraffe</b>: I agree livelyMonkey - they are the authors family, not her husband's.  Even though you gain your spouse's family there still has to be some boundaries. <br><b>inspiredDolphin</b>: We should live independently. This happens to everyone when we depend things on other person. <br><b>eagerGiraffe</b>: And is the author assuming her husband has more free time because she is working on a degree?  What responsibilities does he have?  Is mother-in-law calling him when he is otherwise occupied expecting a translation? <br><b>livelyMonkey</b>: Definitely, eagerGiraffe. If she sounded more appreciative than expectant, her husband might not be as bothered. <br><b>lightGorilla</b>: While it's hard not to feel comfortable in the language, efforts should be made. Then people are more willing to help if efforts are made <br><b>inspiredDolphin</b>: Using the technology solves this problem. <br><b>lightGorilla</b>: Very good points <br><b>livelyMonkey</b>: In summary, I think she's the asshole in this scenario. <br><b>eagerGiraffe</b>: Yes -technology has provide a lot of new options in translation than were available even 10 years ago. <br><b>lightGorilla</b>: Technology is good but only if you know how to use it <br><b>novelOtter</b>: Yeah I agree, we don't know how old she is either, so maybe she doesn't know how to use it.  <br><b>inspiredDolphin</b>: Even siri and ok google do that <br><b>lightGorilla</b>: Yes, she is the a-hole due to expectations placed on the hubby <br><b>eagerGiraffe</b>: In conclusion I think the author is an asshole for expecting her husband to be available at anytime to translate for her mother. <br><b>inspiredDolphin</b>: Woman should not depend not anyone. she should start using the technology <br><b>inspiredDolphin</b>: she is not an asshole <br>"

But I lean more to her being an a-hole, because no where does it say that she discussed the translations needs with her husband. <br><b>delightedBison</b>: I am considering that the wife is TA because she is not setting boundries of her mom asking her husband.

There is nothing wrong with communicating in your language. <br><b>fulfilledBear</b>: They are living in her home. If they want to have a private conversation they should go in a separate room. It’s disrespectful for them to not consider her. If it wasn’t a big deal they could have finished it in English  <br><b>curiousElephant</b>: I have been in similar situations.

Although I understand he son's husband is not comfortable with is English, it's not an excuse to make his mother feel so badly. <br><b>inquisitiveOtter</b>: I agree curiousHorse <br><b>openHippo</b>: I also feel like the mother is being dramatic, she is not incapable of 'catching-up' with her son. He can still speak english. <br><b>lightCamel</b>: This one was a bit difficult but I don't think the son was an asshole. The son and mother should try to understand each other's views and not put the son in the middle. <br><b>curiousHorse</b>: at the very least he could have done a 50 50 split of German and English and TRANSLATED for his pained mom so she felt included. That is what I would have done.  <br><b>lightCamel</b>: I agree with openHippo <br><b>excitedZebra</b>: Agree  <br><b>openHippo</b>: I agree, that he could have at least translated, but I don't think he is in the complete wrong for just speaking german with his uncomfortable partner. <br><b>curiousHorse</b>: I think her son could have handled that a lot better.  <br><b>excitedZebra</b>: The son didn’t try to forge a bridge  <br><b>inquisitiveOtter</b>: Yes excitedZebra <br><b>inquisitiveOtter</b>: Son could have handled it better for sure.  <br><b>lightCamel</b>: That's fair. <br><b>curiousHorse</b>: Everyone could have given a little. Her son could have spoke english 50% of the time and german 50%. this would also help his husband learn to be more comfortable. <br><b>curiousHorse</b>: the husband should have tried speaking english too sometimes. <br><b>inquisitiveOtter</b>: And maybe mom would learn some German.  <br><b>curiousHorse</b>: yeah and mom could learn some german too. it could have been a lot more inclusive for all if everyone gave a little <br><b>inquisitiveOtter</b>: I think being shy about speaking a 2nd language coupled with probably being nervous to be at your in-laws house deepens this issue a bit.  <br><b>curiousHorse</b>: instead the son didn;t care as much about his mom's feelings as he did his husbands. sad. <br><b>inquisitiveOtter</b>: I think OP is probably trying to help his husband through his language insecurities and make him feel comfortable, but then caused this problem.  <br><b>openHippo</b>: As someone who speaks a second language, sometimes I also just revert to english because it's easier to get my point across. so i can understand that sentiment. <br><b>curiousHorse</b>: they all could have done better for each other and learned something <br><b>openHippo</b>: Yeah <br><b>curiousHorse</b>: instead the son just decided his mom's feelings were not as important. <br><b>lightCamel</b>: I think everyone is a bit of an asshole here pretty equally. <br><b>inquisitiveOtter</b>: On reddit i think it might be an ESH- everybody sucks here.  <br><b>curiousHorse</b>: I think the son was an asshole, but they all could have done better. <br><b>openHippo</b>: I don't think it was completely assholish. <br><b>inquisitiveOtter</b>: Not completely, but also not totally innocent either.  <br><b>lightCamel</b>: The mom and SIL could have each made more of an effort to communicate, and the son could have done better connecting the two to make them both feel more comfrotable. <br><b>curiousHorse</b>: yeah I agree with light lightCamel  <br><b>openHippo</b>: I think the mother was completely still capable of bonding with her son at the end of the day. <br><b>inquisitiveOtter</b>: Right.

While he says he talked to the mother-in-law in a kind and respectful manner, his language/defensive language in his Reddit post leads me to believe he may not be as cordial as he lets on. <br><b>fulfilledHorse</b>: I think he's kind of the asshole.  Older people have a harder time learning new languages, for one thing. It doesn't sound like she's calling every 5 minutes or anything, just when she needs help.  <br><b>delightedElephant</b>: This person is definitely the asshole. I have a situation very similar to this story my Mil  is from Mexico and has been here for 29 years and still speaks very broken English. The way he went about it was very white privilege speaking.  <br><b>fulfilledHorse</b>: I agree with brightBison -- he sounds like his not being very helpful about it. Surely coming at it from a ""let's learn together!"" would be nicer and better received. <br><b>fulfilledHorse</b>: Also if that's his only issue with his inlaws he is lucky indeed. Just translate for her. <br><b>brightBison</b>: Helperbot is suggesting to view both sides. From this person's perspective, he's not an asshole for wanting the mother-in-law to learn English, but he could've gone about it in a more tactful manner. <br><b>fulfilledHorse</b>: I know that he's frustrated, and sure some days he might not feel like helping but...just set a few boundaries.  No calls before 10am maybe. <br><b>delightedElephant</b>: As for his side, he should consider being kind and helping in a way that isn’t perceived as white privilege. <br><b>novelMonkey</b>: i believe she is an asshole, despite their misunderstanding for 8 years and their decision to care for the two children in different weeks. she could at least give the gratitude  of making the 2 kids happy by attending the reunion   <br><b>openCamel</b>: He could have approached her in a different way. He was annoyed by her constant demands. He does seem kind of like the asshole. Although I feel the mother in law and rest of family are overreacting. <br><b>delightedElephant</b>: My conclusion is that he is an asshole and he needs to be more understanding of her situation <br><b>fulfilledHorse</b>: Ok it looks like we agree he's the asshole.  except for novelMonkey talking about the wrong scenario. <br><b>openCamel</b>: I conclude he is the asshole and should be more sensitive to older peoples needs. <br><b>fulfilledHorse</b>: he should find a better way to deal with the issue that isn't offensive <br>"

She's not completely an asshole, it's ok to expect some help from husband. But she shouldn't throw it all on him. <br><b>inquisitiveBison</b>: I feel like the person is a bit too entitled to her husband's free time. Yes, it would be nice if he helps out, but he has a life too, even though she claims she's busier. <br><b>livelyBear</b>: I am Magine recurring translations can be frustrating, And it would be helpful if the mother learn the basics in English since she’s living in a primarily English-speaking area <br><b>fulfilledElephant</b>: She should have asked her husband if it was ok for him to translate. Regardless she is not the asshole  <br><b>openGiraffe</b>: They should both be helping her mom. <br><b>openGiraffe</b>: She shouldn't expect him to do it single-handedly, but he should help.  Again I think boundaries are the answer; he should set times he's available, or help mom learn the language actively. <br><b>lightZebra</b>: she should equally help her mother to solve the translation not pushing to her husband always. or better still pay for a class for the mother   <br><b>inquisitiveBison</b>: She says her parents have been trying to make it in the USA their whole lives.

But he should not be used as a servant. <br><b>delightedGorilla</b>: He could've acted nicer to his mother in law and tell her about this at a family picnic or something <br><b>fulfilledHippo</b>: Just providing her with sources to learn English won't truly help, unless they just didn't work for her. <br><b>fulfilledHippo</b>: I agree that he should have talked to his wife first. <br><b>inspiredBear</b>: He also could have asked his wife to help interpret once and awhile as well to lessen the burden on him if it was bothering him this much <br><b>brightDolphin</b>: I also agree he should have talked to the wife first. I think he was being an asshole. <br><b>fulfilledHippo</b>: And maybe they could have came up with something that could help them. <br><b>excitedElephant</b>: He mentioned he offered to help her learn English, so I don't think it was meant to be mean. <br><b>curiousBison</b>: It's true that he may have come off as a bit rude but I believe that he was trying to ask her in the nicest way possible to learn English so that she can become more independent and assimilate better in society. <br><b>livelyCamel</b>: I dont think he offered her to learn english, he gave her random places to look and told her to learn english  <br><b>novelZebra</b>: He could maybe set some boundaries as to times when he's available to help, but telling someone else they need to learn a new language is a bit out of line <br><b>fulfilledHippo</b>: But I can also see that he may have been holding all of this in until he ""exploded."" <br><b>excitedElephant</b>: Anybody would feel used if that was happening to them. <br><b>novelZebra</b>: I still think he was an asshole in the way he handled the situation <br><b>inspiredBear</b>: He needed to go about it differently in my opinion. <br><b>excitedElephant</b>: On the other hand, I can she how she might feel bad. <br><b>livelyCamel</b>: I don't believe everyone would have done this if they were in the same situation. I think he is the asshole <br><b>curiousBison</b>: Perhaps if the mother in law made an attempt or took an initiative to learn English, he wouldn't have come off as mean. <br><b>delightedGorilla</b>: an old lady is not going to learn english as easy as a middle age or young man <br><b>livelyCamel</b>: we also don't know what she has done to try to learn english. I doubt this was her first encounter with the language <br><b>fulfilledHippo</b>: Maybe she did make an attempt or initiative, but it's harder for her because she's only able to grasp things a certain way. <br><b>curiousBison</b>: On the other hand, perhaps the mother in law just doesn't have free time on her hands to take up the time to learn English. <br><b>excitedElephant</b>: He should have gone about it in a different way, but saying he is racist when he learned Spanish and other languages and is also married to someone of a different race is absurd. <br><b>novelZebra</b>: The thought of learning something new at her age might be intimidating <br><b>inspiredBear</b>: 8 years is a long time too. A relationship has been built that shouldn't have been potentially damaged like this. <br><b>livelyCamel</b>: he might not be racist, but he is still an asshole about how he went about this  <br><b>fulfilledHippo</b>: Yes, 8 years is a long time. <br><b>fulfilledHippo</b>: I feel that he kept his emotions in for too long. <br><b>curiousBison</b>: Overall, I don't think that the man was being an asshole and made decent attempts to talk to his mom. <br>"

This is marriage. He could talk to her about what is frustraiting and they could work it out together.

It's reasonable for the person with more free time currently to take on the small extra task of helping out. <br><b>delightedBear</b>: Yeah, I can agree with that. I think that the husband could very easily convey his feelings to the mom though. Like he could just help her learn how to figure stuff out on her own by showing her duolingo or rosetta stone and how to use them <br><b>openZebra</b>: Yeah good point <br><b>novelElephant</b>: Having the mom go straight to the husband maybe not helping in their communications <br><b>eagerDolphin</b>: I kind of agree with livelyGorilla but would word it more like they're both being kind of assholes lol.

I think how he defined the boundary was assholish. But not the fact that he did. If that makes any sense.  <br><b>openZebra</b>: Totally agree eagerDolphin <br><b>lightGiraffe</b>: At any rate someone has to be the asshole <br><b>livelyGorilla</b>: I think she should be kinder and more understanding of how stressful it can be to help. I think she should ask rather than order. But, I think that maybe he should react in a better way especially to his in-laws. <br><b>delightedBear</b>: yeah that makes sense, eagerDolphin I agree with that <br><b>novelElephant</b>: and same on her end - reasonable to expect help but could go about it in a more respectful way <br><b>eagerDolphin</b>: I think the wife is the asshole for basically expecting her husband to be a translator when he is obviously annoyed by it.  <br><b>novelElephant</b>: sounds like we think she is the asshole then? <br><b>excitedHorse</b>: I agree. <br><b>lightGiraffe</b>: im ok with it <br><b>delightedBear</b>: a mild asshole lol <br><b>openZebra</b>: I think so too, that she is the asshole here.

I wouldn't be very pleased if they were contacting me all the time to translate either. Talking to the wife is a good point. <br><b>fulfilledZebra</b>: I think it was okay for him to be direct.

Her husband isn't her family's personal taskmaster. <br><b>openElephant</b>: I think she's being a bit of an asshole too. <br><b>novelGiraffe</b>: Also, it's important to note that the husband is not a native spanish speaker, and offered other apps like duolingo. <br><b>inspiredBison</b>: she's an asshole for making her husband do that <br><b>inspiredBison</b>: it's not his job <br><b>curiousCamel</b>: I don't think the poster is an asshole. They clearly don't have as much time to do this and it doesn't seem like that unreasonable of a time commitment <br><b>lightHippo</b>: I think she's acting a little entitled, but I also feel like I want a better idea of how often he is being asked to translate. <br><b>excitedDolphin</b>: If you move anywhere in the world you will have to learn the language that is spoken there. It doesn't matter what the ""official"" language is - it matters what people speak.  <br><b>brightZebra</b>: She's putting a burden that she doesn't want, on to her husband  <br><b>fulfilledOtter</b>: yes, she is being TA.  she should not impose that on him, especially her own mother. <br><b>inspiredBison</b>: Yes, it's a burden on her husband <br><b>openElephant</b>: Yeah, it just isn't his responsibility and she has offloaded it on him as if it is. <br><b>delightedMonkey</b>: I also don't understand how recommending learning a new language makes him privileged.   <br><b>novelGiraffe</b>: I get that because they are married that it's his family, but constantly calling the husband for translations and stuff when there is google translate and other alternatives would get super annoying <br><b>inspiredBison</b>: I would find it annoying if I had to translate all the time for my  wife's parents <br><b>fulfilledOtter</b>: the fact that the husband does not like it should be a good indicator that she is imposing on him. <br><b>lightHippo</b>: If she's busy and in a Master's program, I don't think it's that big of a deal to ask him every once in a while, as she describes. But if it is constant, then she should seek alternatives. <br><b>excitedDolphin</b>: There is nothing privileged about using Rosetta Stone. Most libraries offer it or something similar for free along with use of their computers. <br><b>novelGiraffe</b>: The husband is not in the wrong for politely suggesting the poster's mother learn English or seek alternatives. <br><b>curiousCamel</b>: They supposedly live in a predominately Latinx area of Cali so there shouldn't be that high of a demand for English translation <br><b>fulfilledOtter</b>: there's probably a cultural disconnect. <br><b>novelGiraffe</b>: By relying on the husband to translate for her, the mother in law is putting herself at a disadvantage, by relying on someone else for a necessity. <br><b>excitedDolphin</b>: And it sounds like her family often makes fun of him. He's putting up with a lot. <br><b>openElephant</b>: Yeah, and there are plenty of free phone apps that offer translation stuff too. Just so many alternatives and he's made it clear it feels like an imposition. <br><b>inspiredBison</b>: So overall I think she's not an asshole after discussing it with you guys <br><b>novelGiraffe</b>: I think she is the asshole <br><b>curiousCamel</b>: It's not unreasonable to ask the mother to learn English, but it's not asshole-ish to ask for spot translations <br><b>excitedDolphin</b>: She's the asshole. <br><b>fulfilledOtter</b>: yes agreed <br><b>openElephant</b>: Yeah, same. <br><b>novelGiraffe</b>: I think it is assholeish to pass a job onto someone when they obivously don't feel comfortable doing so <br><b>delightedMonkey</b>: I think she is TA because it's not his responsibility.  <br><b>curiousCamel</b>: Offering duolingo and other things is a good start but there definitely needs to more of a conversation between the poster and the husband about this <br><b>inspiredBison</b>: So all agree she's an asshole? <br><b>novelGiraffe</b>: Exactly. She's the asshole <br><b>fulfilledOtter</b>: I would hate to put that kind of burden on my spouse, especially if they don't like it. it's different if they are willing to help. <br><b>excitedDolphin</b>: Yes, she's the asshole. They've somehow united against him. That isn't what family is about either. <br><b>novelGiraffe</b>: It seems like the poster just assumed her husband would help, without asking first. <br><b>openElephant</b>: In any case, I would feel like an asshole if I made my spouse do translating when they didn't want to, so yeah, I think she's the asshole. <br><b>novelGiraffe</b>: She said she ""passed it onto her husband"" because he isn't busy <br><b>brightZebra</b>: I can understand that she would be annoyed that it seems like he doesn't want to help, but she's being unreasonable in expecting him to drop whatever he's doing to play the role of translator  <br><b>lightHippo</b>: I don't think it's his responsibility and if it were someone he didn't know well at all, it would be a more clearcut situation. But I feel like maybe we're assuming some things that we don't know from the post alone. <br><b>fulfilledOtter</b>: She should have apologized for the burden and give him a break or two. <br><b>novelGiraffe</b>: Is there anyone that thinks she is not the asshole? <br><b>lightHippo</b>: I do think his wife should take his feelings more into consideration than her post implies. <br><b>lightHippo</b>: I'm kind of on the fence, I don't think it's asshole-ish to ask for help, but maybe asshole-ish to react the way she did when he confronted her. <br><b>fulfilledOtter</b>: yes, big A <br><b>novelGiraffe</b>: So do we all agree she is the asshole? <br><b>delightedMonkey</b>: I think so  <br><b>brightZebra</b>: I agree  <br><b>novelGiraffe</b>: Okay <br><b>openElephant</b>: Yeah, she's the asshole <br><b>curiousCamel</b>: yes <br><b>excitedDolphin</b>: You guys need to vote in the poll above. <br>"
