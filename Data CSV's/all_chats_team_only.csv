0,0,5e84cc3c50f6e364321d6265,smallGiraffe,2020-04-20T18:28:20.136Z,I don't think the guy is the a$$hole. Thoughts?

0,0,5d482ea421c9be351f762255,youngLion,2020-04-20T18:28:30.637Z,I can see how the family is upset because they feel the mother was disrespected but I can also understand the guy's feelings. Why should he have to work as interpreter for his mother in law?
0,0,5e7e1e0031f4e454e196c30b,niceRhino,2020-04-20T18:28:50.848Z,"Yes, I think his feeling makes sense to me to. Who doesn't want to be independent."

0,0,5e84cc3c50f6e364321d6265,smallGiraffe,2020-04-20T18:30:20.031Z,I think he tried to help her.  He gave her resources to use and she apparently didn't use them.

0,0,5d482ea421c9be351f762255,youngLion,2020-04-20T18:30:50.423Z,I think he wouldn't be so upset about it if she at least tried.
0,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762ae5,culturedBear,2020-04-20T18:30:51.928Z,He should also ask his wife to step up and talk to the mother to healp her learn more and to make herself more available to her mother to help with translations.
0,0,5e84cc3c50f6e364321d6265,smallGiraffe,2020-04-20T18:31:02.701Z,I agree that learning a foreign language as an adult is more difficult but 8 years is a long time.
0,0,5e7e1e0031f4e454e196c30b,niceRhino,2020-04-20T18:31:30.459Z,I think that both sides have right and wrong. But overall i think he's not an asshole because of the way he approached the issue (politely) and because he also tried in his own way (although some of us may say not effective) to help her

0,2,5d6feec65f80ae21f5c5f054,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-20T18:58:25.941Z,I think she's an asshole. Her husband has the right to not want to be a translator. It's his choice and he shouldn't be forced.

1,0,5e84cc1450f6e364321d6260,spryGorilla,2020-04-20T18:37:34.857Z,It sounds like he reached his boiling point and she called at a bad time so he reached his breaking point
1,0,5e9de4e29dc0406f89872254,newHippo,2020-04-20T18:37:36.526Z,It seems like if we're all going toa gree it'd be easier to make the case for him being an asshole.

1,0,5e9de5be9dc0406f8987226c,culturedPanda,2020-04-20T18:38:48.538Z,It's realistically not reasonable to ask for someone to learn a new language
1,0,5e8b3c3e36ec0e1294b36931,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-20T18:39:00.414Z,I still think he was being polite

1,0,5e9de4c49dc0406f8987224f,youngPig,2020-04-20T18:39:08.405Z,He seems arrogant because he thinks it's as easy for everyone else to learn a language as it was for him.
1,0,5e84cc1450f6e364321d6260,spryGorilla,2020-04-20T18:39:13.085Z,On one side he did learn portuges and rusian in two years.

1,3,5e9de5be9dc0406f8987226c,littleHorse,2020-04-20T19:20:44.174Z,I think she is an asshole. He should not be expected to have to translate everything for his family in law.
1,3,5e9de5be9dc0406f8987226c,littleHorse,2020-04-20T19:20:50.938Z,"Besides, why can't she just do it?"
1,3,5e9de4e29dc0406f89872254,newCow,2020-04-20T19:20:55.515Z,It also only REALLY works if you talk about the subject explicitly before getting married.
1,3,5e9de4c49dc0406f8987224f,likelySquirrel,2020-04-20T19:20:58.846Z,She isn't the asshole. She's working on a better life for everyone involved.
1,3,5e8b6f06b35db8283c501ca6,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-20T19:21:07.089Z,I think she is an asshole because her husband is obviously unhappy.

1,3,5e8b6f06b35db8283c501ca6,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-20T19:21:17.536Z,I think you have a responsibility to listen to your spouse.
1,3,5e9de4e29dc0406f89872254,newCow,2020-04-20T19:21:22.204Z,But she probably didn't.
1,3,5e9de4e29dc0406f89872254,newCow,2020-04-20T19:21:26.500Z,I think she's an asshole.
1,3,5e9de4c49dc0406f8987224f,likelySquirrel,2020-04-20T19:21:55.801Z,The husband has more free time and it's a way he can contribute to helping the family.
1,3,5e9de5be9dc0406f8987226c,littleHorse,2020-04-20T19:22:03.340Z,It's not his family though

1,3,5e8b6f06b35db8283c501ca6,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-20T19:22:24.006Z,I feel like this could be solved with better communication tbh.

1,3,5e9de5be9dc0406f8987226c,littleHorse,2020-04-20T19:22:28.035Z,Yeah
1,3,5e9de4c49dc0406f8987224f,likelySquirrel,2020-04-20T19:22:36.208Z,He married her. They became family.
1,3,5e9de5be9dc0406f8987226c,littleHorse,2020-04-20T19:22:42.556Z,"It;'s not a huge deal, sit down, communicate and it could all be solved"
1,3,5e9de5be9dc0406f8987226c,littleHorse,2020-04-20T19:23:07.100Z,"Exactly. He married her, to help take care of her, and his and her's kids. Not her mom"

1,3,5e9de4e29dc0406f89872254,newCow,2020-04-20T19:23:48.386Z,I think we should all vote her the asshole either way.
1,3,5e9de4e29dc0406f89872254,newCow,2020-04-20T19:23:59.371Z,"Even if she's not wrong, the idea is to be able to get along."
1,3,5e8b6f06b35db8283c501ca6,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-20T19:24:07.954Z,I think she's the asshole because she thinks she's not wrong. She never mentioned her husband's feelings.
1,3,5e9de5be9dc0406f8987226c,littleHorse,2020-04-20T19:24:10.952Z,"I think to look at both sides, what likelySquirrel said would make sense but she's still an asshole"
1,3,5e9de5be9dc0406f8987226c,littleHorse,2020-04-20T19:24:14.533Z,Exactly.
1,3,5e9de4c49dc0406f8987224f,likelySquirrel,2020-04-20T19:24:16.335Z,Family is about who came before AND after.
1,3,5e9de4c49dc0406f8987224f,likelySquirrel,2020-04-20T19:24:41.387Z,All generations should be considered
1,3,5e9de5be9dc0406f8987226c,littleHorse,2020-04-20T19:25:06.654Z,"Well, I wouldn't get married to anyone if it meant becoming a full time translator."
1,3,5e84cc1450f6e364321d6260,littleBear,2020-04-20T19:25:06.674Z,i believe that you sholud always help out family.
1,3,5e8b6f06b35db8283c501ca6,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-20T19:25:36.830Z,"I think that's a cultural difference,"
1,3,5e9de4c49dc0406f8987224f,likelySquirrel,2020-04-20T19:25:43.303Z,littleHorse nobody said it's fulltime.
1,3,5e9de5be9dc0406f8987226c,littleHorse,2020-04-20T19:25:45.274Z,"You should help them out, but to a certain extent. Becoming a full time translator would be a no for me"

1,3,5e9de5be9dc0406f8987226c,littleHorse,2020-04-20T19:26:11.756Z,she calls whenever she has a probblem
1,3,5e9de5be9dc0406f8987226c,littleHorse,2020-04-20T19:26:14.798Z,"hence, full time"
1,3,5e84cc1450f6e364321d6260,littleBear,2020-04-20T19:26:23.164Z,I would not want to be a translater
1,3,5e9de4c49dc0406f8987224f,likelySquirrel,2020-04-20T19:26:25.975Z,It's an occasional thing. He isn't following her around 24/7
1,3,5e9de5be9dc0406f8987226c,littleHorse,2020-04-20T19:26:34.466Z,But he;s on call 24/7.
1,3,5e84cc1450f6e364321d6260,littleBear,2020-04-20T19:26:38.034Z,i dont think this person was an asshole
1,3,5e9de5be9dc0406f8987226c,littleHorse,2020-04-20T19:26:43.925Z,"If it was occasional, I'm sure he wouldn't be irrtated."
1,3,5e9de4c49dc0406f8987224f,likelySquirrel,2020-04-20T19:26:49.349Z,And it's just a phone call.
2,2,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryOrangutan,2020-04-20T19:14:17.569Z,Hi!
2,2,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,littleSquirrel,2020-04-20T19:14:21.878Z,Hello
2,2,5e9de6b89dc0406f898722c6,smallRhino,2020-04-20T19:14:22.877Z,hello!
2,2,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,smallBear,2020-04-20T19:14:27.322Z,"Hey all, finally people!"
2,2,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,snappyBison,2020-04-20T19:14:28.935Z,hello.
2,2,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryOrangutan,2020-04-20T19:14:32.600Z,yes finally!
2,2,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryOrangutan,2020-04-20T19:14:40.515Z,So what do you guys think?
2,2,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,littleSquirrel,2020-04-20T19:14:42.269Z,What's everyone first impression
2,2,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,snappyBison,2020-04-20T19:14:48.905Z,I feel like everyone is the asshole lol.
2,2,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryOrangutan,2020-04-20T19:14:58.631Z,I think the guy is the asshole in this instance
2,2,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,littleSquirrel,2020-04-20T19:14:58.860Z,I think this one is tricky because there's some room for cultural miserunderstanding too
2,2,5e9de6b89dc0406f898722c6,smallRhino,2020-04-20T19:14:59.244Z,My initial thoughts are that she is not the asshole.
2,2,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,smallBear,2020-04-20T19:15:05.387Z,"I do think it is a little unreasonable for her to expect her husband to field these calls all the time. It's one thing to pass the phone to him if she's with him and he agrees, but I would also be annoyed to get calls directly about it."
2,2,5e9de6b89dc0406f898722c6,smallRhino,2020-04-20T19:15:26.404Z,"I would be annoyed too, but I do think you marry into someone's family when you marry them"
2,2,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,smallBear,2020-04-20T19:15:38.845Z,"I get that very close-knit families of any culture would expect to always help out family, but marrying into it doesn't always bring that same kind of obligation"
2,2,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,snappyBison,2020-04-20T19:15:45.370Z,"Sure, but there has to be a limit."
2,2,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,snappyBison,2020-04-20T19:16:02.681Z,At what point is the husband justified in refusing to translate any more?
2,2,5e9de6b89dc0406f898722c6,smallRhino,2020-04-20T19:16:03.522Z,That's true-- I guess it would help to know how often the family is actually bothering him. 
2,2,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,littleSquirrel,2020-04-20T19:16:10.737Z,It does seem like she just assumed he would help - I wonder if that had a conversation where she shared what it felt like growing up if it would help 
2,2,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,smallBear,2020-04-20T19:16:15.580Z,I think ideally they would stop calling him directly and she would ask each time she gets a call and is busy if he doesn't mind helping.
2,2,5e9de6b89dc0406f898722c6,smallRhino,2020-04-20T19:16:20.382Z,"I feel like 1-2 times a week is justified, but if it is everyday I think that would be a lot."
2,2,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryOrangutan,2020-04-20T19:16:22.633Z,"Agree to the points above, its hard to expect the husband to always take the call and for the wife to not even screen"
2,2,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,snappyBison,2020-04-20T19:16:23.299Z,and shouldn't the wife understand / be willing to take his feelings into consideration?
2,2,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,littleSquirrel,2020-04-20T19:16:49.296Z,"Translating can take a lot of mental energy too, it's not a quick thing"
2,2,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,smallBear,2020-04-20T19:16:57.404Z,"I also don't know how ""less busy"" the husband is - sometimes people with very physically busy jobs assume someone with mentally tasking jobs are ""less busy""."
2,2,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryOrangutan,2020-04-20T19:17:08.672Z,They should just set filters and the wife should be more considerate about how the husband feels
2,2,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,snappyBison,2020-04-20T19:17:16.007Z,Agreed
2,2,5e9de6b89dc0406f898722c6,smallRhino,2020-04-20T19:17:20.021Z,"very true-- I guess we don't really know the true circumstances, either. "
2,2,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,littleSquirrel,2020-04-20T19:17:23.815Z,They could just hire people too to help translate
2,2,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,littleSquirrel,2020-04-20T19:17:28.728Z,Might be a compromise somewhere
2,2,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryOrangutan,2020-04-20T19:17:36.144Z,Or refer them to Google translate
2,2,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryOrangutan,2020-04-20T19:17:39.347Z,haha or Alexa
2,2,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,smallBear,2020-04-20T19:17:40.769Z,I think we have to agree yes or no if she is the asshole though.
2,2,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryOrangutan,2020-04-20T19:17:49.862Z,she is the asshole IMO
2,2,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,snappyBison,2020-04-20T19:17:51.211Z,"Well i feel like even though we're just being presented with the wife's side, we still feel like the husband is sort of justified"
2,2,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,smallBear,2020-04-20T19:17:55.341Z,Yes there are many apps for on-the-go voice translating now!
2,2,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,snappyBison,2020-04-20T19:17:57.790Z,"so that makes her the asshole i think, no?"
2,2,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,littleSquirrel,2020-04-20T19:17:57.804Z,I don't think she's the asshole
2,2,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,smallBear,2020-04-20T19:18:20.625Z,Using an app would do the same purpose as calling the husband
2,2,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,snappyBison,2020-04-20T19:18:38.669Z,"idk, im with spryOrangutan i think she's the asshole"
2,2,5e9de6b89dc0406f898722c6,smallRhino,2020-04-20T19:18:47.537Z,I kind of think she is too
2,2,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,smallBear,2020-04-20T19:18:50.193Z,"I agree she is the asshole here, there has to be compromise."
2,2,5e9de6b89dc0406f898722c6,smallRhino,2020-04-20T19:18:58.009Z,I'd like to know how many times he is being called though. 
2,2,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,littleSquirrel,2020-04-20T19:19:19.547Z,Yeah but I guess if we think shes the asshole then does 2 times a week versus 5 really matter
2,2,5e9de6b89dc0406f898722c6,smallRhino,2020-04-20T19:19:29.521Z,And she should still talk to her parents and ask them to call her first or send a text or something so it's more manageable. 
2,2,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryOrangutan,2020-04-20T19:20:34.202Z,"yeah. there are a lot of details to consider but unfortunately, we can only go by what is in the text. Agree with shooting the quick text even before the call, the wife may not even know how much calls the husband is getting"
2,2,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,snappyBison,2020-04-20T19:21:03.407Z,"I think she is the asshole regardless of how many calls the husband is receiving, as it appears she is not taking his feelings into consideration."
2,2,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryOrangutan,2020-04-20T19:21:04.088Z,"Im thinking that there would be a reason why suddenly, the husband called the situation into attention when previously it was fine"
2,3,5e9de6b89dc0406f898722c6,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-20T19:29:18.601Z,hello!
2,3,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,smallBison,2020-04-20T19:29:20.312Z,Hey guys.
2,3,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T19:29:23.791Z,Hello! Nice to have someone to talk to about this
2,3,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,littleGoat,2020-04-20T19:29:28.064Z,Hey again some of  you
2,3,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T19:29:37.503Z,I feel like the guy is the asshole in this instance
2,3,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:29:38.201Z,WOW! My first thought is this man is incredibly aggressive and an asshole. I felt very offended 
2,3,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,smallBison,2020-04-20T19:29:38.218Z,Interesting case we have here. Initial thoughts?
2,3,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T19:30:22.708Z,"I feel like there could have been other ways to voice his concern and while he may have been polite in talking to his wife's mother about it, it really does seem condescending"
2,3,5e9de6b89dc0406f898722c6,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-20T19:30:22.942Z,"I think he is the asshole too-- I understand that he would want her to learn English, but from the way he spoke he had a very elitist attitude about it that didn't sit well with me."
2,3,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,smallBison,2020-04-20T19:30:26.258Z,"Really?? I felt like he was not the asshole at all here. He comes across as very angry, but I felt like the way he handled it with the mother in law was not bad."
2,3,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:30:28.485Z,I think he has some serious issues with anger and am scared for his wife! What could the other side be?
2,3,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,littleGoat,2020-04-20T19:30:28.618Z,"So at first, I thought the way he said it was very asshole-ish, but I also know what it's like to vent on social media when the actual conversation was much more polite. "
2,3,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,smallBison,2020-04-20T19:30:53.708Z,"Yes littleGoat I agree completely, that was my read on the situation as well."
2,3,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,littleGoat,2020-04-20T19:31:08.239Z,It doesn't sound like anyone asked him if they could call him during the day to help translate. It sounds like he was trying to at least be helpful instead of just not answering the phone anymore
2,3,5e9de6b89dc0406f898722c6,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-20T19:31:17.607Z,"I guess it is good that he offered to help her and provided her with a whole host of resources that she could use to learn English, but it came off as very rude and as if he has a superiority complex."
2,3,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T19:31:28.547Z,I did not particularly like his statement on how easily he can learn several language so he is expecting that learning English would be easy
2,3,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,smallBison,2020-04-20T19:31:30.350Z,"I felt like he came across as an asshole to us the readers, but that he is actually justified in being frustrated and that he handled the situation very appropriately."
2,3,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:31:42.364Z,"I think his ""helpfulness"" was just a way to continue being rude and racist "
2,3,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,smallBison,2020-04-20T19:32:24.009Z,"Eh, if you read how he explained things to the mother in law, it doesnt seem to me like he was being rude or racist."
2,3,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T19:32:24.379Z,Agree with sna
2,3,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T19:32:28.358Z,sna
2,3,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,littleGoat,2020-04-20T19:32:31.262Z,"Right, it's easy for us to call him an asshole based on the language he used in his posting. He could have just ignored them all and refused to help, but he at least tried. His mental judgments are crude to us but he was trying to..."
2,3,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T19:32:36.315Z,snappyGiraffe
2,3,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T19:32:38.863Z,hahahaha
2,3,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,littleGoat,2020-04-20T19:33:06.295Z,...balance his reaction to being bothered but also trying to solve the problem instead of saying no and refusing to help.
2,3,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:33:12.949Z,It is just so hard to see his side because it seems like he's just using the situationas an excuse to let his racism and general frusterations about wife and family spill over
2,3,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,smallBison,2020-04-20T19:33:19.734Z,"Anyways, so yeah I think the guy's probably an asshole in real life, but in this situation i do not think he was the asshole."
2,3,5e9de6b89dc0406f898722c6,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-20T19:33:23.387Z,"True-- I think he should have reworded and it isn't necessarily racist to say she should learn English (not that it is an easy thing to do, but she struggled in certain situations and knowing English, regardless of race, would help her)"
2,3,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,smallBison,2020-04-20T19:33:25.926Z,Gotta vote not the asshole for this one.
2,3,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:33:42.408Z,"I think he's the asshole, there's too many other ways he could have handled it"
2,3,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,smallBison,2020-04-20T19:33:48.949Z,such as?
2,3,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:33:53.889Z,literally any other way
2,3,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,smallBison,2020-04-20T19:33:57.494Z,such as?
2,3,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,littleGoat,2020-04-20T19:34:02.477Z,"I don't think he is an asshole in this situation, even if he's an asshole on Reddit :)"
2,3,5e9de67c9dc0406f898722c3,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T19:34:04.005Z,"I think if he had some thoughts, he could have said it to his wife so she can mediate or explain to him another side to go about it"
2,3,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,littleGoat,2020-04-20T19:34:25.152Z,I think they still would have thought he was an asshole if he just refused to help at all.
2,3,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:34:26.047Z,"Not yell, not use racist language"
2,3,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,smallBison,2020-04-20T19:34:35.057Z,he didn't use racist language....
2,3,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,smallBison,2020-04-20T19:34:36.096Z,what?
2,3,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,littleGoat,2020-04-20T19:34:43.484Z,He didn't in the actual conversation with the MIL.
2,3,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:34:58.056Z,"""I told her I'm sick of dealing with her shit because she can't speak english, she's been here for 8 years she should be able to speak english by now"""
2,3,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:35:01.296Z,quote from him 
2,3,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:35:10.197Z,Why does it matter if someone learns English?
2,3,5e877eb4a44a3116d9b95f15,littleGoat,2020-04-20T19:35:15.592Z,He later clarified that.
2,3,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,smallBison,2020-04-20T19:35:16.269Z,quote from him in his post. not in what he said to her..
2,3,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:35:26.463Z,"he said ""I told her"" ...."
2,3,5e8b395036ec0e1294b35f15,smallBison,2020-04-20T19:35:30.001Z,if you had read his edit at the bottom you'd have seen that.
2,3,5e31d69ee31c5304c46f13ef,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:36:00.383Z,Yeah he said that after people had yelled at him
3,1,5e9dea789dc0406f89872547,youngWolf,2020-04-20T19:26:24.220Z,Hello
3,1,5e9de4ec9dc0406f89872255,culturedCow,2020-04-20T19:26:30.093Z,Hi
3,1,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872251,culturedGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:26:32.564Z,hello hello
3,1,5e84cfe850f6e364321d63bf,smallSquirrel,2020-04-20T19:26:33.527Z,hello
3,1,5e9de7589dc0406f898722cd,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-20T19:26:38.420Z,howdy
3,1,5e9dea789dc0406f89872547,youngWolf,2020-04-20T19:26:42.725Z,I think the lady is an asshole.
3,1,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872251,culturedGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:26:51.283Z,do you think she is the asshole?
3,1,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872253,youngBison,2020-04-20T19:26:53.578Z,i thing they well
3,1,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872251,culturedGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:26:54.125Z,i dont think so 
3,1,5e84cfe850f6e364321d63bf,smallSquirrel,2020-04-20T19:26:56.034Z,I think they should have included the mom in the conversation
3,1,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872251,culturedGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:27:01.084Z,true 
3,1,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872253,youngBison,2020-04-20T19:27:04.506Z,they off family
3,1,5e9dec4e9dc0406f898726cd,newRabbit,2020-04-20T19:27:05.940Z,So in this case I don't think the poster is being an asshole. His husband is uncomfortable speaking in english and he is just trying to make him comfortable.
3,1,5e84cfe850f6e364321d63bf,smallSquirrel,2020-04-20T19:27:06.624Z,it is uncomfortable
3,1,5e9de4ec9dc0406f89872255,culturedCow,2020-04-20T19:27:09.424Z,My initial impression is the lady is an asshole
3,1,5e9dea789dc0406f89872547,youngWolf,2020-04-20T19:27:16.234Z,She could have maintained the english language policy
3,1,5e9dec4e9dc0406f898726cd,newRabbit,2020-04-20T19:27:18.470Z,It seems like his husband probably doesn't speak proficient english. 
3,1,5e9dea789dc0406f89872547,youngWolf,2020-04-20T19:27:23.435Z,It was just for the weekend
3,1,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872253,youngBison,2020-04-20T19:27:29.339Z,lady asshole
3,1,5e9de7589dc0406f898722cd,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-20T19:27:36.092Z,I don't think she's an asshole for talking in German to her husband though
3,1,5e84cfe850f6e364321d63bf,smallSquirrel,2020-04-20T19:27:39.926Z,only for 1 weekend
3,1,5e9de4ec9dc0406f89872255,culturedCow,2020-04-20T19:27:44.614Z,She must have followed english language rather than german.
3,1,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872253,youngBison,2020-04-20T19:27:45.061Z,the man have no happness
3,1,5e9dec4e9dc0406f898726cd,newRabbit,2020-04-20T19:27:51.990Z,"When you all are saying she do you mean the mom? The original poster is male married to another male, just want to make sure I understand"
3,1,5e84cfe850f6e364321d63bf,smallSquirrel,2020-04-20T19:28:01.796Z,yeah i do
3,1,5e9de7589dc0406f898722cd,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-20T19:28:03.805Z,it's a man
3,1,5e9dec4e9dc0406f898726cd,newRabbit,2020-04-20T19:28:06.543Z,So do you all think the mom or the son is the asshole?
3,1,5e9dea789dc0406f89872547,youngWolf,2020-04-20T19:28:10.013Z,"if the husband doesn't speak speak proficient English, it doesn't matter"

3,1,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872253,youngBison,2020-04-20T19:28:16.200Z,yes
3,1,5e9de7589dc0406f898722cd,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-20T19:28:17.989Z,you're right it's a male.
3,1,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872253,youngBison,2020-04-20T19:28:19.266Z,agree
3,1,5e9de7589dc0406f898722cd,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-20T19:28:28.819Z,Either way she's going to be stuck translating between the two
3,1,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872253,youngBison,2020-04-20T19:28:35.094Z,male is good
3,1,5e9de4ec9dc0406f89872255,culturedCow,2020-04-20T19:28:46.690Z,"Husband and wife both live together for life long. So they can speak German whenever they want. But while with family member for some time, they should follow what the member speaks."
3,1,5e9dec4e9dc0406f898726cd,newRabbit,2020-04-20T19:28:53.590Z,There is no wife.
3,1,5e84cfe850f6e364321d63bf,smallSquirrel,2020-04-20T19:28:57.599Z,two men
3,1,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872253,youngBison,2020-04-20T19:28:58.388Z,his mother also 
3,1,5e9de7589dc0406f898722cd,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-20T19:29:08.075Z,since it seems like he's going to have problem speaking to the mom. Since he doesn't always no the right words
3,1,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872253,youngBison,2020-04-20T19:29:09.395Z,wife is too bad
3,1,5e9de7589dc0406f898722cd,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-20T19:29:16.279Z,This is a gay couple
3,1,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872251,culturedGiraffe,2020-04-20T19:29:23.229Z,exactly.  He doesnt know the right words 
3,1,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872253,youngBison,2020-04-20T19:29:30.415Z,yes

3,3,5e9dea789dc0406f89872547,culturedHippo,2020-04-20T19:57:42.692Z,Mother is not an asshole
3,3,5e9de7589dc0406f898722cd,smallGorilla,2020-04-20T19:57:43.785Z,"there is no language issue though, he just has an accent"

3,3,5e9dec4e9dc0406f898726cd,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T19:58:29.616Z,"Oh ok! He might be much more comfortable speaking in french, but they can continue to speak in french on their own time."

3,3,5e9dec4e9dc0406f898726cd,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T19:59:49.173Z,"I say mother is not asshole, but I'm willing to listen to arguments from the other side."
3,3,5e9de7589dc0406f898722cd,smallGorilla,2020-04-20T19:59:56.123Z,I mean I guess she could not try and involve herself in their personal conversations maybe?
3,3,5e9dea789dc0406f89872547,culturedHippo,2020-04-20T20:00:03.670Z,i believe the mother is an asshole

3,3,5e9de4ec9dc0406f89872255,snappyWolf,2020-04-20T20:00:13.776Z,I considered both the side and came to conclusion that mother is not asshole.
3,3,5e9de7589dc0406f898722cd,smallGorilla,2020-04-20T20:00:14.421Z,"I'm for not the asshole, but that might be a reason for it"
3,3,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872251,youngRhino,2020-04-20T20:00:24.789Z,no she defeinetly isnt
3,3,5e9dea789dc0406f89872547,culturedHippo,2020-04-20T20:00:25.488Z,I mean mother is not an asshole
3,3,5e9dec4e9dc0406f898726cd,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T20:00:33.533Z,"We have to talk about why, just saying you think the mother is an asshole isn't giving a reason."
3,3,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872251,youngRhino,2020-04-20T20:00:43.902Z,i think they shoudl all just speka the same lanugue toghter
3,3,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872251,youngRhino,2020-04-20T20:00:51.218Z,and chat in enlgish in private
3,3,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872253,youngOrangutan,2020-04-20T20:00:55.594Z,that is correct
3,3,5e9dec4e9dc0406f898726cd,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T20:00:59.837Z,"Son in law can speak english, he is choosing not to with the mother there"
3,3,5e9dec4e9dc0406f898726cd,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T20:01:07.277Z,youngOrangutan is english your first language?
3,3,5e9de4ce9dc0406f89872253,youngOrangutan,2020-04-20T20:01:25.287Z,why you asking
3,3,5e9de4ec9dc0406f89872255,snappyWolf,2020-04-20T20:01:25.710Z,"When everyone can speak a common language, it would be good and comfortable to speak in that language."
3,3,5e9de7589dc0406f898722cd,smallGorilla,2020-04-20T20:01:27.498Z,like why is she trying to butt into their conversation kinda deal. If they want to talk to her then they'll switch to english? maybe thats what youngOrangutan means
3,3,5e9dec4e9dc0406f898726cd,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T20:01:36.689Z,Because you're not making much sense
3,3,5e9dec4e9dc0406f898726cd,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T20:01:53.612Z,That makes sense smallGorilla I could see how they would feel she is butting in
3,3,5e9dec4e9dc0406f898726cd,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T20:02:20.296Z,But i also think it is extremely rude to purposefully exclude someone who is in the room with you
3,3,5e9de7589dc0406f898722cd,smallGorilla,2020-04-20T20:02:43.542Z,I just feel if you're going to someone else homes to visit you should try and include them
3,3,5e9de7589dc0406f898722cd,smallGorilla,2020-04-20T20:02:50.334Z,Like what's the point of visiting them then
3,3,5e9dec4e9dc0406f898726cd,spryRabbit,2020-04-20T20:02:52.323Z,I agree. It's her home.

4,0,5e9f11d29dc0406f89875089,youngCow,2020-04-21T16:02:19.334Z,I think he was respectful. He even offered to help her learn.
4,0,5e9f13589dc0406f89875291,spryDonkey,2020-04-21T16:02:27.544Z,"i don't think he was an asshole. although it did come off a little mean initially, his updated edit said that he was being respectful"
4,0,5e9f0e1c9dc0406f89874dcd,likelySquirrel,2020-04-21T16:02:35.510Z,I think he is not an asshole
4,0,5e9f0f209dc0406f89874f09,littleLion,2020-04-21T16:02:36.603Z,"yeah i don't think he was an asshole, it's not fair to make him translate all the time like that"
4,0,5d482eab21c9be351f76415b,spryGoat,2020-04-21T16:02:37.367Z,I agree
4,0,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,spryOrangutan,2020-04-21T16:02:44.440Z,"He addressed her respectfully, despite feeling pretty aggravated, and he offered to help her.  Beyond that she has lived in the US for quite some time, so the fact that she doesn't speak conversational English is on her."
4,0,5e9f13589dc0406f89875291,spryDonkey,2020-04-21T16:02:44.945Z,my standpoint from this is they should learn english because what if no one is around to help them? what if it's an emergency?
4,0,5d482eab21c9be351f76415b,spryGoat,2020-04-21T16:02:57.915Z,exactly
4,0,5e9f106a9dc0406f89874f9f,culturedHippo,2020-04-21T16:03:00.812Z,very true
4,0,5e9f0ef89dc0406f89874ecc,newRhino,2020-04-21T16:03:02.458Z,Agreed to some extent
4,0,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,spryOrangutan,2020-04-21T16:03:08.400Z,"I'd understand her wanting help for the first few months of living here, but almost a decade after the fact is insane."
4,0,5e9f0e1c9dc0406f89874dcd,likelySquirrel,2020-04-21T16:03:09.099Z,Because he tried in all way that he cold help her. 
4,0,5e9f0f209dc0406f89874f09,littleLion,2020-04-21T16:03:12.929Z,"yeah, i think it comes down to how he said it and he seems like he was respectful"
4,0,5d482eab21c9be351f76415b,spryGoat,2020-04-21T16:03:14.351Z,they will be better off in the longrun if they learn english and not be so dependent on him
4,0,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,spryOrangutan,2020-04-21T16:03:14.991Z,especially because he has his own life.
4,0,5e9f0ef89dc0406f89874ecc,newRhino,2020-04-21T16:03:18.695Z,they don't have to be fluent however basic skills should be good enough
4,0,5e9f0ef89dc0406f89874ecc,newRhino,2020-04-21T16:03:22.582Z,what do you think
4,0,5e9f13589dc0406f89875291,spryDonkey,2020-04-21T16:03:23.945Z,agreed 
4,0,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,spryOrangutan,2020-04-21T16:03:26.419Z,I'd be angry if I was getting phone calls in the middle of the day.
4,0,5d482eab21c9be351f76415b,spryGoat,2020-04-21T16:03:38.036Z,It would definitely be frustrating
4,0,5e9f13589dc0406f89875291,spryDonkey,2020-04-21T16:03:39.202Z,and he provided resources to help
4,0,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,spryOrangutan,2020-04-21T16:03:43.347Z,I totally agree. Being fluent isn't required by you need to be able to perform the most basic tasks.
4,0,5e9f0e1c9dc0406f89874dcd,likelySquirrel,2020-04-21T16:04:06.376Z,Though he is not an asshole he must have helped on crucial times.
4,0,5e9f0f209dc0406f89874f09,littleLion,2020-04-21T16:04:48.129Z,I can't imagine getting calls at all hours of the day to help with menial tasks.
4,0,5e9f0f209dc0406f89874f09,littleLion,2020-04-21T16:05:01.712Z,It sounds like he has helped for a while too.
4,0,5e9f0e1c9dc0406f89874dcd,likelySquirrel,2020-04-21T16:05:23.755Z,He didn't help all the time but he tried to help them in learning a language in some ways. For me he is not an asshole.
4,0,5e9f0f209dc0406f89874f09,littleLion,2020-04-21T16:06:04.366Z,I think after eight years it is fair to assume that you learn basic communications for day to day stuff and emergencies.
4,0,5e9f0f209dc0406f89874f09,littleLion,2020-04-21T16:06:24.272Z,And like you said he provided plenty of resources to help her learn.
4,3,5e9f11d29dc0406f89875089,snappyBison,2020-04-21T16:46:05.519Z,She is the asshole.
4,3,5e9f0e1c9dc0406f89874dcd,youngOrangutan,2020-04-21T16:46:06.600Z,Hi
4,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76415b,spryPig,2020-04-21T16:46:09.847Z,Hi.
4,3,5e9f0ef89dc0406f89874ecc,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-21T16:46:11.461Z,Hello
4,3,5e9f0f209dc0406f89874f09,spryMonkey,2020-04-21T16:46:15.185Z,hi
4,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76415b,spryPig,2020-04-21T16:46:27.793Z,I think she is the asshole because she shouldn't be making her husband translate..it's her family.
4,3,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,niceLion,2020-04-21T16:46:28.722Z,"For this scenario, I can understand that it's family and he should help a bit, but I'm calling her the asshole. It's a one sided conversation!"
4,3,5e9f13589dc0406f89875291,nicePanda,2020-04-21T16:46:33.357Z,i think she's an asshole for putting her problems onto her husband 
4,3,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,niceLion,2020-04-21T16:46:48.483Z,she's basically forcing him to translate at her mom's leisure or face social consequences
4,3,5e9f0ef89dc0406f89874ecc,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-21T16:46:53.185Z,She is an asshole to put too much pressure on her husband
4,3,5e9f0e1c9dc0406f89874dcd,youngOrangutan,2020-04-21T16:46:59.281Z,My initial impression is she is not an asshole. She has no time to help her parents. 
4,3,5e9f0f209dc0406f89874f09,spryMonkey,2020-04-21T16:47:14.773Z,I think she's an asshole for assuming he'd handle it. Yes it's his extended family but it's her mother. He has a life too.
4,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76415b,spryPig,2020-04-21T16:47:17.478Z,But i'm sure her husband has other things to do as well
4,3,5e9f13589dc0406f89875291,nicePanda,2020-04-21T16:47:18.594Z,and the parents should learn english especially if they can't even read a menu.. how will they deal with emergencies when no one is available?
4,3,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,niceLion,2020-04-21T16:47:19.540Z,"Beyond that, I'm calling her out for using 'privilege' as means to explain why her parents shouldn't feel obligated to pick up some solid conversational english"
4,3,5e9f11d29dc0406f89875089,snappyBison,2020-04-21T16:47:19.963Z,They have been there for eyars. Her mother should have picked up at least a few words of English to get through her usual errands and to do list items. 
4,3,5e9f13589dc0406f89875291,nicePanda,2020-04-21T16:47:44.963Z,agreed
4,3,5e9f11d29dc0406f89875089,snappyBison,2020-04-21T16:47:50.215Z,Not to have done so is simply lazy or a willful resistance to making her life and everyone else's life easier. 
4,3,5e9f106a9dc0406f89874f9f,littleHippo,2020-04-21T16:47:52.834Z,"I agree as well, parents have had time to learn English and wife only assumes husband has free time"
4,3,5e9f0f209dc0406f89874f09,spryMonkey,2020-04-21T16:47:53.925Z,I just don't see why it's his responsibility... sometimes is okay but she shouldn't be oawning it off like that.
4,3,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,niceLion,2020-04-21T16:47:54.013Z,she's privilege baiting and that makes her the asshole
4,3,5e9f0e1c9dc0406f89874dcd,youngOrangutan,2020-04-21T16:47:56.977Z,But she can't learn the entire language right!!
4,3,5e9f0ef89dc0406f89874ecc,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-21T16:48:01.548Z,I totally agree given the scenario because laziness is not an excuse
4,3,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,niceLion,2020-04-21T16:48:19.655Z,^
4,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76415b,spryPig,2020-04-21T16:48:30.755Z,he would probably help her learn english..then she wouldn't need the translations so much
4,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76415b,spryPig,2020-04-21T16:48:47.851Z,But it's not his responsibility
4,3,5e9f0e1c9dc0406f89874dcd,youngOrangutan,2020-04-21T16:48:59.651Z,"If she has time, then she would help her parents. "
4,3,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,niceLion,2020-04-21T16:49:01.087Z,He has clearly cared enough to learn Spanish to the extent that he can translate for her
4,3,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,niceLion,2020-04-21T16:49:04.157Z,why can't she do the same?
4,3,5e9f0ef89dc0406f89874ecc,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-21T16:49:11.373Z,yeah it is not his responsibility 
4,3,5e9f13589dc0406f89875291,nicePanda,2020-04-21T16:49:16.016Z,OO this was good
4,3,5e9f13589dc0406f89875291,nicePanda,2020-04-21T16:49:18.514Z,agreed with niceLion
4,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76415b,spryPig,2020-04-21T16:49:29.639Z,I agree as well..
4,3,5e9f0ef89dc0406f89874ecc,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-21T16:49:29.838Z,however he can take initiative volunteerily
4,3,5e9f0e1c9dc0406f89874dcd,youngOrangutan,2020-04-21T16:49:47.555Z,It's not the fact about responsibility. Its just a matter between family bonding.
4,3,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,niceLion,2020-04-21T16:49:52.906Z,"I get that, but volunteering means you choose to help"
4,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76415b,spryPig,2020-04-21T16:49:54.805Z,"He probably would be happy to teach her..but not be ""on call"" all the time."
4,3,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,niceLion,2020-04-21T16:50:09.241Z,He's not getting a choice on when/how he helps. It's being thrown in his lap
4,3,5e9f106a9dc0406f89874f9f,littleHippo,2020-04-21T16:50:13.977Z,"from what I can tell husband has already helped, it's not like he is saying no right off the bat. But it's starting to be too much"
4,3,5e9f0f209dc0406f89874f09,spryMonkey,2020-04-21T16:50:35.057Z,I understand him getting frustrated and I don't think he has an issue helping from time to time... it's an issue getting called upon all the time because his SO is doing her master's
4,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76415b,spryPig,2020-04-21T16:50:38.447Z,"Right, he's happy to help..but to a certain extent..."
4,3,5e9f0e1c9dc0406f89874dcd,youngOrangutan,2020-04-21T16:50:43.500Z,"If not him, then who else can help them?"
4,3,5e9f13589dc0406f89875291,nicePanda,2020-04-21T16:50:46.695Z,yeah it seems like he's helped a decent amount but he's been pushed too far
4,3,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,niceLion,2020-04-21T16:50:57.256Z,they should be able to help themselves
4,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76415b,spryPig,2020-04-21T16:51:08.104Z,"She should make the time to help her mother, it's her mother."
4,3,5e9f0f209dc0406f89874f09,spryMonkey,2020-04-21T16:51:20.895Z,"He's already met them halfway by learning the language, and they seem to be taking advantage of that"
4,3,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,niceLion,2020-04-21T16:51:24.761Z,"I would understand for more complicated items, but if you've been here for that long...Sorry, learn the language where you live"
4,3,5e9f12229dc0406f898750a9,niceLion,2020-04-21T16:51:49.654Z,it's not a race/privilege thing. It's a matter of being a good steward for yourself and your community
4,3,5e9f0f209dc0406f89874f09,spryMonkey,2020-04-21T16:51:50.780Z,"At the very least learn menu items, and simple things in case of emergency"
4,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76415b,spryPig,2020-04-21T16:51:58.186Z,"I agree, they need to learn the language, enough to be able to let someone know your wants, etc"
4,3,5e9f13589dc0406f89875291,nicePanda,2020-04-21T16:52:25.922Z,all about emergencies and what happens when no one is there to translate for you
5,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763ee2,culturedBear,2020-04-21T15:57:26.188Z,i  really dont feel like she did anything wrong
5,1,5e9f0d869dc0406f89874dc3,snappyLion,2020-04-21T15:57:29.776Z,"I said yes because even though it is not really a big dead, they should at least be a little more respectful around his mother."
5,1,5e873b6646f3b80a33438e79,littleRhino,2020-04-21T15:57:30.366Z,so who thinks he is an asshole?
5,1,5e9f0b9c9dc0406f89874c96,snappyGorilla,2020-04-21T15:57:31.504Z,"Although the person wanted to make her husband comfortable, I think she could have done that in a better way. Why didn't she just have the conversation in German + English?"
5,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764270,spryCow,2020-04-21T15:57:33.434Z,"I believe she's the asshole. It's fine for them to speak German in private to make him comfortable, but doing it with her mother around makes it seem like she's being excluded."
5,1,5e9f0d869dc0406f89874dc3,snappyLion,2020-04-21T15:57:39.558Z,Why can't they just talk in German when by themselves?
5,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763ee2,culturedBear,2020-04-21T15:57:42.973Z,if she did it all the time though yeah
5,1,5e9f0b9c9dc0406f89874c96,snappyGorilla,2020-04-21T15:57:47.026Z,Yeah like why would you leave the mother out of a conversation??
5,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763ee2,culturedBear,2020-04-21T15:57:47.044Z,how often does she live in USA
5,1,5e9f0b9c9dc0406f89874c96,snappyGorilla,2020-04-21T15:58:11.438Z,that doesn't really matter though
5,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764270,spryCow,2020-04-21T15:58:11.838Z,It might come down to how often the husband has talked to the mother I guess
5,1,5e9de80c9dc0406f898722dd,littlePanda,2020-04-21T15:58:24.119Z,They have several opinions to consider both of them
5,1,5e9f0d869dc0406f89874dc3,snappyLion,2020-04-21T15:58:32.118Z,Yeah I'd say like around the dinner table to just talk in English.
5,1,5e9f0b9c9dc0406f89874c96,snappyGorilla,2020-04-21T15:58:32.566Z,The prompt made it sound like they were having conversations in German in front of the mother. Which is bad
5,1,5e873b6646f3b80a33438e79,littleRhino,2020-04-21T15:58:48.934Z,the mother was kind enough to let them stay there. the least he could do is include her in the conversation by at least translating what they are saying or just speaking English since they are guests in her house
5,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764270,spryCow,2020-04-21T15:59:09.750Z,I'd have to agree there
5,1,5e9f0b9c9dc0406f89874c96,snappyGorilla,2020-04-21T15:59:16.430Z,me too
5,1,5e9f0d869dc0406f89874dc3,snappyLion,2020-04-21T15:59:29.507Z,"Yeah I don't think they are major assholes, but still acting a bit selfish."
5,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763ee2,culturedBear,2020-04-21T15:59:30.742Z,i  agree too
5,1,5e9de80c9dc0406f898722dd,littlePanda,2020-04-21T15:59:46.166Z,I would agree that portion to expose that women point of view
5,1,5e9f0b9c9dc0406f89874c96,snappyGorilla,2020-04-21T15:59:46.388Z,so are we voting asshole or no
5,1,5e9f0e9e9dc0406f89874e9d,youngBison,2020-04-21T15:59:51.769Z,I think they are both a bit wrong because she misses her son.  The husband shold bend a bit in her house.
5,1,5e873b6646f3b80a33438e79,littleRhino,2020-04-21T15:59:53.182Z,and explain to the mother that he doesn't feel comfortable speaking English because he messes up on some words
5,1,5e873b6646f3b80a33438e79,littleRhino,2020-04-21T16:00:16.468Z,I say asshole
5,1,5e9f0b9c9dc0406f89874c96,snappyGorilla,2020-04-21T16:00:23.368Z,Me too
5,1,5e9f0e9e9dc0406f89874e9d,youngBison,2020-04-21T16:00:25.950Z,me too
5,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764270,spryCow,2020-04-21T16:00:30.023Z,Yes
5,1,5e9f0d869dc0406f89874dc3,snappyLion,2020-04-21T16:00:30.897Z,yep
5,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763ee2,culturedBear,2020-04-21T16:00:32.624Z,same
5,1,5e9de80c9dc0406f898722dd,littlePanda,2020-04-21T16:01:35.169Z,It was quite good to expose that in-front of mom
5,1,5e873b6646f3b80a33438e79,littleRhino,2020-04-21T16:02:03.938Z,"I love my name...small pig...like, really? lol"

5,1,5e873b6646f3b80a33438e79,littleRhino,2020-04-21T16:03:21.191Z,"pigs arent normally small, and bears arent really cultured lol"
5,1,5e9f0e9e9dc0406f89874e9d,youngBison,2020-04-21T16:03:45.068Z,"whats the point of coming home to visit if they arent catching up, you know? haha :)"
5,2,5e9f0b9c9dc0406f89874c96,newDonkey,2020-04-21T16:12:27.368Z,"To me, the mother was very kind in what she said so she isn't an asshole"
5,2,5e9f0d869dc0406f89874dc3,youngHorse,2020-04-21T16:12:35.450Z,I'm thinking yes because he seem to be overreacting
5,2,5e9f0e9e9dc0406f89874e9d,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-21T16:12:43.420Z,I feel like the mother was in the wrong to stop their conversation.
5,2,5d482eab21c9be351f764270,conventionalRhino,2020-04-21T16:13:01.422Z,She might have overreacted a bit but I don't think she's an asshole.
5,2,5d482eab21c9be351f764270,conventionalRhino,2020-04-21T16:13:07.023Z,As guests they should try and include her
5,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ee2,likelyGiraffe,2020-04-21T16:13:12.844Z,that was kinda mean
5,2,5e9f0b9c9dc0406f89874c96,newDonkey,2020-04-21T16:13:15.237Z,"I don't think the mother did anything wrong. How would you feel if you were sitting in a room with two people speaking a different language? If it was private, then they could say that. "
5,2,5e873b6646f3b80a33438e79,niceCow,2020-04-21T16:13:19.879Z,I don't think the mom is the asshole in this...imagine if you were in a room with others and they started speaking another language knowing you dont know what they are saying...she is the one who should feel awkward not them..
5,2,5e9f0b9c9dc0406f89874c96,newDonkey,2020-04-21T16:13:28.907Z,exactly!
5,2,5e9de80c9dc0406f898722dd,littleBear,2020-04-21T16:13:32.461Z,I feel good to finished their conversation
5,2,5e9f0e9e9dc0406f89874e9d,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-21T16:13:35.930Z,I feel like more information is needed. Was it just this one time they did not include her? 
5,2,5e9f0b9c9dc0406f89874c96,newDonkey,2020-04-21T16:14:01.250Z,idk
5,2,5e9f0e9e9dc0406f89874e9d,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-21T16:14:06.319Z,Was it a one time conversation they slipped in and she got angry?
5,2,5e9f0d869dc0406f89874dc3,youngHorse,2020-04-21T16:14:15.973Z,I guess the way I'm reading it is they were occasionally talking in a different language and not purposely doing it all the time
5,2,5e9f0b9c9dc0406f89874c96,newDonkey,2020-04-21T16:14:16.818Z,she wasn't angry though. 
5,2,5e873b6646f3b80a33438e79,niceCow,2020-04-21T16:14:18.190Z,doesnt matter if it was one time or 100 times. 
5,2,5d482eab21c9be351f764270,conventionalRhino,2020-04-21T16:14:32.409Z,Right it sounds like her son's partner had barely said anything in english the whole time
5,2,5e9f0e9e9dc0406f89874e9d,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-21T16:14:32.769Z,its hard to tell on this one. In this one instance I feel she overreacted and was the asshole. 
5,2,5e873b6646f3b80a33438e79,niceCow,2020-04-21T16:14:34.030Z,she would still feel like they were talking about her or something
5,2,5e9f0b9c9dc0406f89874c96,newDonkey,2020-04-21T16:14:35.175Z,she nicely told them how she felt. She didn't yell or anything
5,2,5e9de80c9dc0406f898722dd,littleBear,2020-04-21T16:14:42.390Z,It doesn't matter at all
5,2,5e9f0b9c9dc0406f89874c96,newDonkey,2020-04-21T16:15:06.032Z,"If she was rude, then yes, this could be considered an asshole situation, but she wasn't rude at all. The prompt says she ""said nicely"""
5,2,5e9f0e9e9dc0406f89874e9d,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-21T16:15:19.822Z,Its hard to tell here
5,2,5e9de80c9dc0406f898722dd,littleBear,2020-04-21T16:15:21.482Z,To be fill their feelings in that time.

5,2,5e9f0b9c9dc0406f89874c96,newDonkey,2020-04-21T16:15:55.321Z,I'm leaning to non-asshole also
5,2,5d482eab21c9be351f764270,conventionalRhino,2020-04-21T16:16:07.738Z,Same

5,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ee2,likelyGiraffe,2020-04-21T16:16:43.460Z,i  agree

5,2,5e9de80c9dc0406f898722dd,littleBear,2020-04-21T16:16:47.992Z,So consider their points

5,2,5e9f0e9e9dc0406f89874e9d,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-21T16:18:11.848Z,but did she overreact?
5,2,5e873b6646f3b80a33438e79,niceCow,2020-04-21T16:18:21.458Z,nope

6,0,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a1,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-21T15:27:16.401Z,"My initial impression is that no the father is not an asshole, it is his house, and his son's husband should respect that."
6,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b5,smallPanda,2020-04-21T15:27:29.278Z,It's tricky. This person is kind of yes and kind of not an asshole
6,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763f55,newGiraffe,2020-04-21T15:27:50.023Z,My impression is that it could go either way also.
6,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763fde,niceMonkey,2020-04-21T15:28:01.511Z,I don't really feel like anyone in the asshole in this situation. the parent does have the right to feel comfortable and included in conversations in their own home but what if the son's partner is uncomfortable with his English skills?
6,0,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a2,youngGoat,2020-04-21T15:28:01.721Z,"It's understandable that since it's his house he would want other people staying there to speak the same language, but my issue here is that the conversation was between his son and his son's partner."
6,0,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a1,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-21T15:28:02.184Z,"I think the father went about it in the wrong way, but I do not think he is a straight up asshole for it. "
6,0,5e9de5509dc0406f89872263,spryWolf,2020-04-21T15:28:14.527Z,"I think it doesn't have much to do with the fact that it's OP's house, but more that the father is being excluded even though they were all in the same room together"
6,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640bf,newBear,2020-04-21T15:28:29.041Z,"I believe that person isn't an asshole, because the other people need to realize that there is another person there and include him in the conversation."
6,0,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a2,youngGoat,2020-04-21T15:28:52.949Z,"Obviously if the father was included in the conversation, they'd speak English presumably... "
6,0,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a1,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-21T15:28:54.576Z,"Yes, they should of told the father what they were talking about, not just simply walked away. "
6,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763fde,niceMonkey,2020-04-21T15:28:55.801Z,do you always have conversations with everyone in the room at the same time as you? the son and the partner might have been discussing something between the two of them
6,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763f55,newGiraffe,2020-04-21T15:29:01.307Z,Could the son's partner not understand English enough that he would also be excluded if the conversation were in English?
6,0,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a1,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-21T15:29:21.341Z,The son's partner did speak English I believe 
6,0,5e9de5509dc0406f89872263,spryWolf,2020-04-21T15:29:28.778Z,"The original text says the partner can speak English, so I presume that the partner is fluent enough."
6,0,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a1,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-21T15:29:58.572Z,"I agree, I never have conversations with everyone in the room at home, sometimes it can just be a personal conversation "
6,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b5,smallPanda,2020-04-21T15:30:06.714Z,"As host, he could have the respect to allow them to talk in french. Maybe the partner is more comfortable using his native language, and we don't know how much or difficult it is for him to speak english."
6,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763fde,niceMonkey,2020-04-21T15:30:14.725Z,"I still don't think the parent is the asshole though, even if the conversation that triggered all this was personal between the son and partner."
6,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640bf,newBear,2020-04-21T15:30:42.415Z,Maybe they were trying to plan something to suprise him?
6,0,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a2,youngGoat,2020-04-21T15:30:52.102Z,"Usually on reddit there's an option to say no one's the asshole here, but we do have to choose."
6,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763f55,newGiraffe,2020-04-21T15:30:59.950Z,I believe the parent should have been less direct and not accuse them of disrespect.
6,0,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a2,youngGoat,2020-04-21T15:31:04.221Z,I would definitely say the father.
6,0,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a1,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-21T15:31:09.232Z,"I would say he is not, I think there was just a misunderstanding"
6,0,5e9de5509dc0406f89872263,spryWolf,2020-04-21T15:31:20.690Z,We can guess all we want about their intentions for speaking French but we only have the original text.
6,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640bf,newBear,2020-04-21T15:31:44.227Z,"I say no, that he isn't an asshole."
6,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b5,smallPanda,2020-04-21T15:32:09.243Z,I say not an asshole
6,0,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a1,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-21T15:32:11.842Z,"Yes, I believe he should of been less direct, but he is not a asshole"
6,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763fde,niceMonkey,2020-04-21T15:32:15.138Z,ultimately I agree it was more of a misunderstanding then straight asshole behavior. he just went about expressing his discomfort in an awkward way.
6,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763fde,niceMonkey,2020-04-21T15:32:17.465Z,not the asshole
6,0,5e9de5509dc0406f89872263,spryWolf,2020-04-21T15:32:18.849Z,"I believe that OP not an asshole, but definitely could have handled it better."
6,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640bf,newBear,2020-04-21T15:32:29.557Z,"I say no, he isn't an asshole."
6,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763f55,newGiraffe,2020-04-21T15:32:34.267Z,I agree with spryWolf
6,0,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a2,youngGoat,2020-04-21T15:33:00.400Z,I just think how he approached it was quite close minded.
6,3,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a2,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-21T16:11:48.780Z,If the conversation concerns her then obviously they will speak English but I'm sure they want to talk to each other since they're partners. She can't make her husband feel left out or he'll never want to come back again. 
6,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f55,spryOrangutan,2020-04-21T16:11:56.207Z,I believe the son should have been a translator making both parties comfortable.
6,3,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a2,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-21T16:12:01.984Z,NTA
6,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763fde,youngBear,2020-04-21T16:12:08.864Z,so I don't think this person is an asshole at all. he's walking a fine line trying to make his husband comfortable but also include his mom.
6,3,5d482eab21c9be351f7640bf,smallRabbit,2020-04-21T16:12:10.607Z,I think she was in a tough spot with trying to please her mom and husband.
6,3,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b5,snappySquirrel,2020-04-21T16:12:18.042Z,"I don't think she's an asshole, but maybe she could translate if it makes her mom feel better. "
6,3,5e9de5509dc0406f89872263,likelyHippo,2020-04-21T16:12:23.827Z,Yeah I think OP is making a sincere effort to consider both sides
6,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763fde,youngBear,2020-04-21T16:12:38.944Z,I agree with conventionalGiraffe if the conversation concerns mom they should speak English but otherwise it's kind of him to want his husband to feel comfortable
6,3,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a1,newLion,2020-04-21T16:12:39.717Z,I think she is in a situation where she has to choose between her mom and husband and thats not really fair
6,3,5d482eab21c9be351f7640bf,smallRabbit,2020-04-21T16:12:41.017Z,I don't think she was an asshole either.
6,3,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a1,newLion,2020-04-21T16:13:00.517Z,I think maybe she should of explained the situation to her mother beforehand
6,3,5e9de5509dc0406f89872263,likelyHippo,2020-04-21T16:13:14.510Z,I agree with snappySquirrel translating might have been better.
6,3,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a1,newLion,2020-04-21T16:13:18.320Z,"but she is not an asshole for doing it, she was just looking out for her husband"
6,3,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a2,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-21T16:13:34.742Z,"The best she could do is divide her attention better, but definitely not an asshole."
6,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f55,spryOrangutan,2020-04-21T16:13:36.830Z,I think the mother could have had private time to catch up and then no one would have been in a bad situation.
6,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763fde,youngBear,2020-04-21T16:13:52.314Z,"yeah, I think some simple explanation would go a long way. he could simply tell his mom his husband is shy about his English"
6,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763fde,youngBear,2020-04-21T16:14:02.494Z,no one is the asshole though. so I say NTA
6,3,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a1,newLion,2020-04-21T16:14:17.434Z,"Agreed, not an asshole, just a misunderstanding."
6,3,5d482eab21c9be351f7640bf,smallRabbit,2020-04-21T16:14:19.762Z,I think maybe they could of came up with a plan and help each other learn each other language.
6,3,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b5,snappySquirrel,2020-04-21T16:14:48.803Z,For sure could also have had one on one time with mother as well. I agree with youngBear that no one was really an asshole here.
6,3,5d482eab21c9be351f7640bf,smallRabbit,2020-04-21T16:15:12.150Z,Then all of them could try to be more comfortable with the other language.
6,3,5e9de5509dc0406f89872263,likelyHippo,2020-04-21T16:15:17.022Z,"Agreed, no assholes here."
6,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f55,spryOrangutan,2020-04-21T16:15:26.339Z,No one was really an asshole. They just need to learn how to deal with the situation better.
6,3,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a1,newLion,2020-04-21T16:15:48.612Z,"Yes, if they come up with a plan beforehand and explain both sides, I would see no problem."
6,3,5d482eab21c9be351f7640bf,smallRabbit,2020-04-21T16:16:08.595Z,I agree. She wasn't an asshole.
6,3,5e9f0ac09dc0406f898749a2,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-21T16:16:23.267Z,Agreed.

7,1,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,youngCow,2020-04-21T15:39:48.547Z,He's an asshole
7,1,5e9de8489dc0406f898722ef,spryLion,2020-04-21T15:39:53.997Z,I think this person was not being an asshole if he was being polite about it
7,1,5e9decf89dc0406f89872747,littleHippo,2020-04-21T15:40:04.138Z,At first I did think this person was the asshole but I can see both sides of the picture here.  
7,1,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,youngCow,2020-04-21T15:40:04.923Z,He didn't approach it in the right way
7,1,5e543e5ad1db96705ff13ef0,likelyPig,2020-04-21T15:40:06.992Z,"If he'd actually said ""I'm tired of your shit"", he'd be an asshole. But he tried to help her."
7,1,5e9dea1e9dc0406f89872527,likelyRabbit,2020-04-21T15:40:07.689Z,"I understand learning a new language is difficult and there isn't an official language in the USA, but learning English would be beneficial for her."
7,1,5e9deb229dc0406f898725e9,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-21T15:40:07.751Z,He definitely is expecting a lot. Not everyone can learn new languages
7,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76412c,niceRhino,2020-04-21T15:40:08.230Z,I don't necessarily think what he said was wrong but the way he said it made him an asshole.  
7,1,5e9de8489dc0406f898722ef,spryLion,2020-04-21T15:40:10.412Z,"He felt taken advantage of, so he voiced his opinon"
7,1,5e9deb229dc0406f898725e9,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-21T15:40:13.195Z,and the difference in ages is a factor
7,1,5e543e5ad1db96705ff13ef0,likelyPig,2020-04-21T15:40:33.127Z,She's not his responsibility. 
7,1,5e9deb229dc0406f898725e9,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-21T15:40:36.080Z,"It seems like he got super frustrated, and lashed out about it one day."
7,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76412c,niceRhino,2020-04-21T15:40:40.315Z,"Also, learning a new language is not as easy as he is making it sound. "
7,1,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,youngCow,2020-04-21T15:40:41.209Z,"Think about the mother though, was she brought here?  How old is she?  how hard is it to learn a whole new language when you're already like 60"
7,1,5e9decf89dc0406f89872747,littleHippo,2020-04-21T15:40:48.777Z,I agree not everyone can learn languages and the way he went about it was def wrong.  I would think its harder for an older person to learn the language
7,1,5e9dea1e9dc0406f89872527,likelyRabbit,2020-04-21T15:40:49.363Z,I can imagine how annoying it would get having to be a translator everyday.
7,1,5e9de8489dc0406f898722ef,spryLion,2020-04-21T15:40:57.233Z,But she can not always rely on him for basic needs
7,1,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,youngCow,2020-04-21T15:41:07.266Z,"Yeah, he bottled it up, and rage-unleashed it"
7,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76412c,niceRhino,2020-04-21T15:41:14.881Z,He also stated that she tries to call other family members before calling him.  Seems like he is a last resort.
7,1,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,youngCow,2020-04-21T15:41:17.793Z,"so for that, he's an asshole, even if he tried to smooth it over"
7,1,5e9dea1e9dc0406f89872527,likelyRabbit,2020-04-21T15:41:19.408Z,She could use Google translate or get a translation book.
7,1,5e543e5ad1db96705ff13ef0,likelyPig,2020-04-21T15:41:31.316Z,Calling him a racist for not getting their way makes them unrespectable. 
7,1,5e9decf89dc0406f89872747,littleHippo,2020-04-21T15:41:33.473Z,there are so many resources like apps she could use for basic things
7,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76412c,niceRhino,2020-04-21T15:41:35.450Z,"I agree, maybe he should have informed her of Google translate."
7,1,5e543e5ad1db96705ff13ef0,likelyPig,2020-04-21T15:41:38.671Z,There are translation apps.
7,1,5e9de8489dc0406f898722ef,spryLion,2020-04-21T15:41:41.092Z,She does not have to become fluent in order to learn basic phrases to get by
7,1,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,youngCow,2020-04-21T15:41:51.185Z,"yeah, translation apps would have helped"
7,1,5e9decf89dc0406f89872747,littleHippo,2020-04-21T15:41:55.243Z,"I agree the racist, trump supporting comments were totally unnecessary"
7,1,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,youngCow,2020-04-21T15:42:07.543Z,I just don't think he considered her learning situation
7,1,5e9dea1e9dc0406f89872527,likelyRabbit,2020-04-21T15:42:08.984Z,It is best for her and for him if she learned basic English.
7,1,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,youngCow,2020-04-21T15:42:20.738Z,"yes, the trump stuff was very unnecessary"
7,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76412c,niceRhino,2020-04-21T15:42:22.179Z,"Yes, he did not seem racist, just an asshole. But not by what he said, how he went about it. "
7,1,5e9deb229dc0406f898725e9,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-21T15:42:25.355Z,"Yeah, because it seems like he was suggesting learning english out of an actual necessity since she can't do basics alone."
7,1,5e9dea1e9dc0406f89872527,likelyRabbit,2020-04-21T15:42:32.990Z,"Learning a new language is hard, but she needs to try."
7,1,5e9decf89dc0406f89872747,littleHippo,2020-04-21T15:42:33.736Z,and it depends how often she is calling for translation.  
7,1,5e543e5ad1db96705ff13ef0,likelyPig,2020-04-21T15:42:39.671Z,They seem entitled. He was doing it as a favor
7,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76412c,niceRhino,2020-04-21T15:42:47.996Z,Maybe he should have involved his wife in the conversation.
7,1,5e9deb229dc0406f898725e9,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-21T15:42:55.135Z,He offered to help her learn
7,1,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,youngCow,2020-04-21T15:43:00.416Z,"Yes, involving his wife would have helped"
7,1,5e543e5ad1db96705ff13ef0,likelyPig,2020-04-21T15:43:09.932Z, @niceRhino Then he'd be an asshole
7,1,5e9deb229dc0406f898725e9,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-21T15:43:10.162Z,"In terms of showing her the tools he used, and promising to help her along the way"
7,1,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,youngCow,2020-04-21T15:43:18.123Z,He was nice enough to provide other resources too.
7,1,5e9de8489dc0406f898722ef,spryLion,2020-04-21T15:43:28.159Z,"He should have involved his wife, but as long as he addressed his MIL in a respectful way, I don't think there is anything wrong with him telling her this"
7,1,5e543e5ad1db96705ff13ef0,likelyPig,2020-04-21T15:43:41.312Z,agree
7,1,5e9decf89dc0406f89872747,littleHippo,2020-04-21T15:43:43.343Z,But then does she have access to a phone with apps because i know many older people have no clue how to use technology.  His wife def should be involved in this conversation
7,1,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,youngCow,2020-04-21T15:43:45.249Z,Agree
7,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76412c,niceRhino,2020-04-21T15:43:47.575Z,Maybe not @likelyPig. She could have helped the conversation 
7,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76412c,niceRhino,2020-04-21T15:43:57.785Z,Agree
7,1,5e543e5ad1db96705ff13ef0,likelyPig,2020-04-21T15:44:02.650Z,she's got the phone if she calls him from places
7,1,5e9de8489dc0406f898722ef,spryLion,2020-04-21T15:44:29.192Z,true
7,1,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,youngCow,2020-04-21T15:44:30.063Z,"He handled it poorly, which is why he is the asshole in this scenario.  Really so are the family members for calling him a trumper, but it feels like he could have had better control of it."
7,1,5e543e5ad1db96705ff13ef0,likelyPig,2020-04-21T15:44:30.908Z,and they make simple phones especially for older people
7,1,5e9dea1e9dc0406f89872527,likelyRabbit,2020-04-21T15:44:49.890Z,"I think he handled it well, he just didn't word it well in the post."
7,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76412c,niceRhino,2020-04-21T15:44:59.799Z,"Yes, the family seemed to turn on him quickly which makes me think he did not handle it well. "
7,1,5e9de8489dc0406f898722ef,spryLion,2020-04-21T15:45:09.574Z,"In his edit he said he did not address her in the way he intially explained, so I dont think he was being an asshole"
7,1,5e9dea1e9dc0406f89872527,likelyRabbit,2020-04-21T15:45:14.032Z,He is not the asshole because he was thinking of what is best for her and him.
7,1,5e543e5ad1db96705ff13ef0,likelyPig,2020-04-21T15:45:20.771Z,agree. posted poorly
7,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76412c,niceRhino,2020-04-21T15:45:26.610Z,I think that he is the asshole for the way he handled the situation.  
7,1,5e9dea1e9dc0406f89872527,likelyRabbit,2020-04-21T15:45:34.974Z,He handled it well
7,1,5e9decf89dc0406f89872747,littleHippo,2020-04-21T15:45:35.453Z,"The wife could have helped the conversation go smoother and be less of an ""attack"" towards the mother, if she agreed with him that is."
7,1,5e9deb229dc0406f898725e9,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-21T15:45:36.305Z,He clearly was frustrated when he wrote the post
7,1,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,youngCow,2020-04-21T15:45:40.466Z,"I think he is an asshole too.  Well intentioned, but still an asshole"
7,1,5e9decf89dc0406f89872747,littleHippo,2020-04-21T15:45:49.571Z,youngCow agree
7,1,5e543e5ad1db96705ff13ef0,likelyPig,2020-04-21T15:45:52.395Z,I'm guessing the family wasn't available because they were tired too
7,1,5e9deb229dc0406f898725e9,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-21T15:45:59.933Z,maybe they all are tired
7,1,5e9de8489dc0406f898722ef,spryLion,2020-04-21T15:46:08.229Z,perhaps
7,2,5e9deb229dc0406f898725e9,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-21T15:54:41.043Z,"First of all, saying that they made fun of him for not being one of them imemdiately makes me feel like she's the asshole."
7,2,5e9de8489dc0406f898722ef,newCow,2020-04-21T15:54:44.984Z,I believe she is being an asshole if she just expects this of hre husband
7,2,5e543e5ad1db96705ff13ef0,niceHippo,2020-04-21T15:54:46.520Z,Not an asshole. He's helping them when they're not willing to help themselves by trying to learn English.
7,2,5d482eab21c9be351f76412c,culturedGorilla,2020-04-21T15:54:58.958Z,My initial impression is that this person is an asshole for passing on the responsibility of her parents that she took on. 
7,2,5e9decf89dc0406f89872747,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-21T15:55:01.868Z,I dont think hes an asshole here.  I think they are relying too much on the daughter and son in law to translate
7,2,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,snappyBear,2020-04-21T15:55:08.864Z,"The wife is kind of an asshole for making the husband translate all the time, he didn't sign up for that."
7,2,5d482eab21c9be351f76412c,culturedGorilla,2020-04-21T15:55:16.194Z,"She is okay with doing everything here, does not mean her husband has to be okay with it. "
7,2,5e9decf89dc0406f89872747,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-21T15:55:22.094Z,If they immigrated when she was 15 they should tried a little harder to learn the language. 
7,2,5e9de8489dc0406f898722ef,newCow,2020-04-21T15:55:23.997Z,I think she's an asshole in the sense she is burdening her husband
7,2,5e9decf89dc0406f89872747,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-21T15:55:32.516Z,newCow i agree
7,2,5e9dea1e9dc0406f89872527,newPanda,2020-04-21T15:55:35.765Z,I think the wife is the asshole. 
7,2,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,snappyBear,2020-04-21T15:55:44.321Z,"She is burdening her husband, especially for making fun of his spanish"
7,2,5e9deb229dc0406f898725e9,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-21T15:55:48.420Z,"I mean, if they're already excluding him by making fun of him, and then expecting him to be able to help out all of the time."
7,2,5d482eab21c9be351f76412c,culturedGorilla,2020-04-21T15:55:49.306Z,The husband also did not say anything bad.  He gave ideas and other options to try to help.  He was not rude. 
7,2,5e9decf89dc0406f89872747,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-21T15:55:52.752Z,The wife is def the asshole in the situation and should have not pushed this off because he has more free time.
7,2,5e543e5ad1db96705ff13ef0,niceHippo,2020-04-21T15:55:53.856Z,Helping is one thing. But they are having him do it for them instead of learning.
7,2,5e9decf89dc0406f89872747,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-21T15:56:09.217Z,"He also did not confront the parents here, he is having the conversation with his wife about it.  "
7,2,5e9dea1e9dc0406f89872527,newPanda,2020-04-21T15:56:31.334Z,"I get learning a new language is hard, but other people shouldn't have to constantly hault their lives to translate. "
7,2,5e9decf89dc0406f89872747,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-21T15:56:38.118Z,agreed
7,2,5e9deb229dc0406f898725e9,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-21T15:56:51.471Z,"There's also a difference between helping out the parents after them having worked hard, and them being able to be a little bit self sufficient"
7,2,5d482eab21c9be351f76412c,culturedGorilla,2020-04-21T15:57:00.659Z,"The wife should have asked him before assuming he could do it since ""he has more time"". "
7,2,5e9dea1e9dc0406f89872527,newPanda,2020-04-21T15:57:04.212Z,She should be independant. Or the daughter should be the one translating.
7,2,5e543e5ad1db96705ff13ef0,niceHippo,2020-04-21T15:57:06.691Z,It wasn't a surprise that they'd need English.
7,2,5e543e5ad1db96705ff13ef0,niceHippo,2020-04-21T15:57:20.148Z,"Besides, there's an app for that."
7,2,5e9de8489dc0406f898722ef,newCow,2020-04-21T15:57:25.531Z,She should take more responsbility
7,2,5e9dea1e9dc0406f89872527,newPanda,2020-04-21T15:57:37.126Z,Agreed
7,2,5e9decf89dc0406f89872747,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-21T15:57:41.099Z,I can understand translating important documents but def not menus and simple things. They should learn the basics andnot just be relying
7,2,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,snappyBear,2020-04-21T15:57:41.266Z,"The wife's excuse that she doesn't have enough time and her husband does is weak.  It's her family, and yes, he married into it, but he married her first and foremost"
7,2,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,snappyBear,2020-04-21T15:58:16.013Z,"That said, being in a new country, and learning a new language is always difficult"
7,2,5e9dea1e9dc0406f89872527,newPanda,2020-04-21T15:58:17.537Z,"Yes, he married for her companionship, not to work as a translator"
7,2,5d482eab21c9be351f76412c,culturedGorilla,2020-04-21T15:58:18.325Z,The first few sentences she says how they make fun of her husband.  It seems like the wife has an us vs. him mentality and her husband is not a part of her team
7,2,5e9deb229dc0406f898725e9,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-21T15:58:46.309Z,exactly
7,2,5e543e5ad1db96705ff13ef0,niceHippo,2020-04-21T15:58:48.425Z,yes. They don't think he deserves enough respect to disagree
7,2,5e9decf89dc0406f89872747,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-21T15:58:48.954Z,culturedGorilla I agree with that.  
7,2,5e877e32a44a3116d9b95ef1,snappyBear,2020-04-21T15:58:58.897Z,"Yes, well put culturedGorilla"
7,2,5e9deb229dc0406f898725e9,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-21T15:59:10.716Z,he is immediately being excluded from the family
7,2,5e9de8489dc0406f898722ef,newCow,2020-04-21T15:59:28.019Z,"She should have been nicer with delivery to her husband as well, not just assume he will do it"
7,2,5e9deb229dc0406f898725e9,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-21T15:59:31.370Z,"so it makes her a bit of the asshole just expecting him to pick up her slack, when they make fun of him for not being one of them"
7,2,5e9de8489dc0406f898722ef,newCow,2020-04-21T15:59:45.492Z,Agreed
7,2,5d482eab21c9be351f76412c,culturedGorilla,2020-04-21T15:59:49.231Z,I also agree that he can be consulted for legal documents and stuff like that but as someone said small things maybe they should use an app or google translate

8,3,5e9f4fc69dc0406f8987a506,littleGiraffe,2020-04-21T21:31:34.663Z,There is no wife. 
8,3,5e9f37529dc0406f89877680,nicePanda,2020-04-21T21:31:41.003Z,She also said its privileged assumption that the mom learn some English
8,3,5e9f4de69dc0406f8987a25d,smallPig,2020-04-21T21:32:08.432Z,yes
8,3,5e9f53cc9dc0406f8987ac5a,snappyMonkey,2020-04-21T21:32:30.951Z,I am sure they can get her a subscription
8,3,5e9f50169dc0406f8987a5aa,niceRhino,2020-04-21T21:32:30.999Z,daughter needs to stop passing the buck
8,3,5e9f37529dc0406f89877680,nicePanda,2020-04-21T21:32:47.562Z,I guess it never actually states wife or he/she but the person in the story is the asshole
9,1,5e9f48469dc0406f8987976c,newMonkey,2020-04-21T20:24:32.557Z,"Hi, my initial impression is that the writer is the asshole."
9,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bb5,smallCow,2020-04-21T20:24:48.013Z,"Yes, I agree that the writer is the asshole as well."
9,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d6b,snappyWolf,2020-04-21T20:24:56.523Z,"Hello, that's my impression as well."
9,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7641ca,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-21T20:25:01.724Z,I agree. I think she is making a big deal out of nothing.
9,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764047,niceHippo,2020-04-21T20:25:08.917Z,I believe the mother is be the asshole. 
9,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c90,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:25:11.818Z,"My first impression is that the parent isn't the asshole, particularly."
9,1,5e9f48469dc0406f8987976c,newMonkey,2020-04-21T20:25:45.128Z,I think they are the asshole primarily because they could have had a private discussion or asked to learn a few phrases in French so that they could feel included.
9,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764047,niceHippo,2020-04-21T20:25:59.606Z,I don’t think communicating in a native language is being disrespectful. 
9,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c90,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:26:04.970Z,I can understand that they want to be included in at least SOME conversations. But I agree newMonkey they should have spoken more privately about it
9,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764047,niceHippo,2020-04-21T20:26:38.214Z,If the mother felt left out she should of approached it differently. 
9,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bb5,smallCow,2020-04-21T20:26:58.560Z,"Yes, my thoughts exactly niceHippo"
9,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d6b,snappyWolf,2020-04-21T20:27:09.535Z,"Yea, I think I would be okay with it if she talked to him privately first."
9,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7641ca,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-21T20:27:30.726Z,Yep. I would feel awkward talking in a foreign language (english) if I speak French to my husband. But don't mind if was asked nicely.
9,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bb5,smallCow,2020-04-21T20:27:38.580Z,"I think that she is the asshole because she is assuming that they don't want to include her, but perhaps they just assumed that she would not mind them talking in French."
9,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c90,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:27:45.579Z,I agree somewhat niceHippo -- But I don't think she's an asshole about it?
9,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764047,niceHippo,2020-04-21T20:28:09.090Z,She could of simply asked what they were talking about as to engage them both.
9,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c90,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:28:18.713Z,"I guess I see that calling it ""disrespectful"" is asshole-ish"
9,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bb5,smallCow,2020-04-21T20:28:55.532Z,"Yeah, there is some grey area, but I am leaning towards asshole a little more than not the asshole."
9,1,5e9f48469dc0406f8987976c,newMonkey,2020-04-21T20:29:12.501Z,"I agree, I think the situation was handled poorly. There is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to feel included but it could have been approached in a kinder way"
9,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d6b,snappyWolf,2020-04-21T20:29:44.139Z,"For me it mostly depends how she worded it, but i'm leaning more towards asshole based on the post."
9,1,5e9f48469dc0406f8987976c,newMonkey,2020-04-21T20:29:47.398Z,And there's evident entitlement that comes from assuming other people should work to speak your language. She could always make an effort as well 
9,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c90,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:29:50.455Z,"I'm sort of ambivalent. It's just a communication issue, neither side is wrong. You all are on the same page and I feel fine about that *shrug*"
9,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764047,niceHippo,2020-04-21T20:29:59.069Z,"Bottom line, there were lots of other positives ways to approach the subject without giving an air of superiority with the wording “disrespectful “."
9,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c90,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:30:05.504Z,good point newMonkey
9,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764047,niceHippo,2020-04-21T20:30:43.912Z,The mother came off an asshole. 
9,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bb5,smallCow,2020-04-21T20:30:58.643Z,"The way she handled it was a bit distasteful, so I think that she was the asshole. She could have suggested for them to speak English more, instead of demanding it."
9,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c90,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:31:13.879Z,I voted yes in the end.
9,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c90,littleSquirrel,2020-04-21T20:39:27.217Z,"I think the writer is correct, it's her choice what language to speak"
9,2,5e9f48469dc0406f8987976c,youngRabbit,2020-04-21T20:39:36.583Z,"I agree, I do not think this person is the asshole"
9,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c90,littleSquirrel,2020-04-21T20:39:36.701Z,And she is not the asshole.
9,2,5d482eab21c9be351f764047,snappyHorse,2020-04-21T20:39:54.709Z,I think the daughter was a bit of an asshole.
9,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d6b,culturedPig,2020-04-21T20:39:55.818Z,"I agree, I feel she should've talked to him first instead of just calling him a asshole if she had a problem."
9,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c90,littleSquirrel,2020-04-21T20:40:20.880Z,"Oops sorry, the writer is a man, the son."
9,2,5d482eab21c9be351f7641ca,newPanda,2020-04-21T20:40:22.131Z,I agree. He choose to make his husband comfortable and I don't see anything wrong with that
9,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c90,littleSquirrel,2020-04-21T20:40:41.973Z,Snapp
9,2,5e9f48469dc0406f8987976c,youngRabbit,2020-04-21T20:40:44.315Z,"I think the mother knows that they are together (and if they are married, will hopefully be together for a long time), then she should make an effort to learn german or she should not complain"
9,2,5d482eab21c9be351f764047,snappyHorse,2020-04-21T20:40:59.125Z,"The daughter felt she had to “chose” between the hubby and mom, why chose both and translate?"
9,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bb5,newOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:41:21.238Z,"I disagree with that, I think that since he is a guest in his mother's house they should be a little more respectful towards her wishes."
9,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bb5,newOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:42:10.183Z,"If they have a problem with speaking English then maybe they should talk to her about that, but I feel like he should have talked to her about this first before he made that decision."
9,2,5e9f48469dc0406f8987976c,youngRabbit,2020-04-21T20:42:15.271Z,It is definitely a fair point that it is her house but I do not think speaking in a native language should ever be interpreted as being disrespectful 
9,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c90,littleSquirrel,2020-04-21T20:42:29.826Z,snappyHorse Translation can be difficult and exhausting. Although I agree there could have been more compromise.
9,2,5d482eab21c9be351f7641ca,newPanda,2020-04-21T20:43:01.304Z,The mother can just ask what they mean or ask the son to translate without calling him out.
9,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bb5,newOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:43:29.608Z,"True, but that might get really awkward for a long conversation."
9,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bb5,newOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:43:43.723Z,They should definitely seek some sort of middle ground here.
9,2,5e9f48469dc0406f8987976c,youngRabbit,2020-04-21T20:44:05.395Z,"Right, it would be awkward to have a translation. But the husband has indicated that it is awkward for him to speak english."
9,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c90,littleSquirrel,2020-04-21T20:44:09.854Z,I think because it is the mother's house it's even more uncomfortable for the husband. Speaking English and being in not your own family's home is double uncomfortable
9,2,5d482eab21c9be351f764047,snappyHorse,2020-04-21T20:44:12.283Z,The mom hasn’t seen her daughter in years so why can’t the daughter speak English with her mom and have the son practice his English by speaking with her as well?
9,2,5e9f48469dc0406f8987976c,youngRabbit,2020-04-21T20:44:49.786Z,I don't feel like one person's comfort is more important than another's. I think she could learn to speak German as well
9,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d6b,culturedPig,2020-04-21T20:45:17.520Z,"If he doesn't want to translate, he could've also spent some time talking English as well, instead of just German to make her feel included."
9,2,5d482eab21c9be351f764047,snappyHorse,2020-04-21T20:45:51.638Z,I think it’s selfish of the daughter to cater to her husband ignoring her own mother as they haven’t seen each other in years. 
9,2,5d482eab21c9be351f764047,snappyHorse,2020-04-21T20:46:01.063Z,Daughter is definitely an asshole.
9,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bb5,newOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:46:11.586Z,Agreed snappyHorse
10,1,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,niceHippo,2020-04-21T19:59:31.601Z,Hi! I do not think this person was an asshole. 
10,1,5e9f42d89dc0406f89878720,smallMonkey,2020-04-21T19:59:41.088Z,"Hi, I agree!"
10,1,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e6,youngOrangutan,2020-04-21T19:59:41.603Z,no i do not either
10,1,5e9f433c9dc0406f898787dd,smallBison,2020-04-21T19:59:44.939Z,The mother is not an asshole by asking the son and his husband politely to not talk in other language that she doesn't understand
10,1,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e6,youngOrangutan,2020-04-21T19:59:47.621Z,she was nice to have them
10,1,5e9de7129dc0406f898722c9,newCow,2020-04-21T19:59:50.601Z,i dont think so either
10,1,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,niceHippo,2020-04-21T19:59:56.890Z,She was just asking in a public setting where everyone was to just speak in a language that everybody understands so nobody feels left out. 
10,1,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e6,youngOrangutan,2020-04-21T19:59:57.933Z,and it was disrespectful of them
10,1,5e9f433c9dc0406f898787dd,smallBison,2020-04-21T19:59:59.573Z,They are in a shared area of the house
10,1,5e84cbb050f6e364321d6258,likelyPig,2020-04-21T20:00:03.527Z,Hello. That is a great point smallBison
10,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7641c0,youngSquirrel,2020-04-21T20:00:05.493Z,me neither.
10,1,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,niceHippo,2020-04-21T20:00:09.032Z,It is her home and honestly she can have her own rules
10,1,5e9f433c9dc0406f898787dd,smallBison,2020-04-21T20:00:09.530Z,The son and the partner should respect the parents
10,1,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,niceHippo,2020-04-21T20:00:11.852Z,Yes I agree
10,1,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e6,youngOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:00:15.908Z,yes i agree
10,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7641c0,youngSquirrel,2020-04-21T20:00:18.003Z,Plus she was in her own house.
10,1,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,niceHippo,2020-04-21T20:00:25.048Z,Yes Exactly!
10,1,5e9f433c9dc0406f898787dd,smallBison,2020-04-21T20:00:25.824Z,Yup
10,1,5e9de7129dc0406f898722c9,newCow,2020-04-21T20:00:26.718Z,They should talk in english so everyone can undrstand them.
10,1,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e6,youngOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:00:31.322Z,she was being nice and polite in her house correct
10,1,5e9f42d89dc0406f89878720,smallMonkey,2020-04-21T20:00:34.793Z,I think it's the polite thing to do to include your host in your convo. If you want to talk in French - go to your room.
10,1,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,niceHippo,2020-04-21T20:00:44.207Z,"Yes, since he can speak english. "
10,1,5e9de7129dc0406f898722c9,newCow,2020-04-21T20:00:44.669Z,it sounds disrespectful
10,1,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,niceHippo,2020-04-21T20:00:46.046Z,Yes!
10,1,5e9f433c9dc0406f898787dd,smallBison,2020-04-21T20:00:52.059Z,It is a general rule that you should not speak other language to other people when they can't understand you. That's rude.
10,1,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,niceHippo,2020-04-21T20:00:56.763Z,or the son could of translated for them if he was uncomfortable. 
10,1,5e84cbb050f6e364321d6258,likelyPig,2020-04-21T20:01:09.080Z,I think that people can get really sensitive sometimes and it is important to explain to eachother their point of views but I agree that he is not an asshole
10,1,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e6,youngOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:01:09.509Z,"they were going to be with her for a week i couldnt imagine a week with them if that is how it is going to be, how rude of her son."
10,1,5e9f42d89dc0406f89878720,smallMonkey,2020-04-21T20:01:18.460Z,Or explain the difficulty in language of the husband.
10,1,5e9f433c9dc0406f898787dd,smallBison,2020-04-21T20:01:23.630Z,The partner was young too. He seems immature. 
10,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7641c0,youngSquirrel,2020-04-21T20:01:26.521Z,"It said that his partner was proficient at English,"
10,1,5e9f42d89dc0406f89878720,smallMonkey,2020-04-21T20:01:44.531Z,youngSquirrel - I felt that was unclear.
10,1,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e6,youngOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:01:51.292Z,well the partner was acting childesh
10,1,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,niceHippo,2020-04-21T20:01:52.957Z,"Yes I agree, I think the son was making a big deal of this. "
10,1,5e84cbb050f6e364321d6258,likelyPig,2020-04-21T20:02:05.892Z,Yeah it is not a big deal
10,1,5e9f433c9dc0406f898787dd,smallBison,2020-04-21T20:02:07.842Z,"yes, he left the living room and went upstairs. He should have apologize"
10,1,5e84cbb050f6e364321d6258,likelyPig,2020-04-21T20:02:09.731Z,In my opinion
10,1,5e9de7129dc0406f898722c9,newCow,2020-04-21T20:02:21.308Z,my conclusion is that person is an asshole and he should understand his dad's opinion.
10,1,5e84cbb050f6e364321d6258,likelyPig,2020-04-21T20:02:25.337Z,They should have talked it out more
10,1,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e6,youngOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:02:31.271Z,exactly he shouldnt of been so rude. 
10,1,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,niceHippo,2020-04-21T20:02:44.787Z,Yes there was way to communicate but they just shut down 
10,1,5e9f42d89dc0406f89878720,smallMonkey,2020-04-21T20:02:50.346Z,newCow - the person is the parent and not the son. 
10,1,5e9f433c9dc0406f898787dd,smallBison,2020-04-21T20:02:51.303Z,yes I agree
10,1,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,niceHippo,2020-04-21T20:02:55.471Z,Making it more awkward. 
10,1,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,niceHippo,2020-04-21T20:03:04.254Z,Yes so the person is not an asshole. 
10,1,5e9f433c9dc0406f898787dd,smallBison,2020-04-21T20:03:11.184Z,yes. she is not an asshole
10,1,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e6,youngOrangutan,2020-04-21T20:03:11.286Z,no no asshole here

10,3,5e9de7129dc0406f898722c9,newGiraffe,2020-04-21T20:29:23.664Z,he is an ashole
10,3,5e9f433c9dc0406f898787dd,youngMonkey,2020-04-21T20:29:36.804Z,He should respect his mom. She is very nice to host them and feed them.
10,3,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,culturedBison,2020-04-21T20:29:37.354Z,She is offering him a place to stay and all meals at home. 
10,3,5e9f433c9dc0406f898787dd,youngMonkey,2020-04-21T20:29:41.471Z,Yes
10,3,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,culturedBison,2020-04-21T20:29:43.621Z,The least he can do is be respectful. 
10,3,5e9f42d89dc0406f89878720,culturedCow,2020-04-21T20:29:44.731Z,I think that just talking with his mom and explaining his partner being shy would be great.
10,3,5d482eab21c9be351f7641c0,smallPig,2020-04-21T20:29:44.813Z,I think he was very rude to his mother

10,3,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,culturedBison,2020-04-21T20:30:11.433Z,But just cutting them off in the conversation like that is so disrespectful. 
10,3,5e9f433c9dc0406f898787dd,youngMonkey,2020-04-21T20:30:20.820Z,The husband can speak English so he should speak and practice his English.

10,3,5e9f433c9dc0406f898787dd,youngMonkey,2020-04-21T20:31:26.673Z,it should be fair
10,3,5e9de7129dc0406f898722c9,newGiraffe,2020-04-21T20:31:30.246Z,"he could translate to his husband or i think his husband would understand that much english, he is just shy to speak"

10,3,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,culturedBison,2020-04-21T20:32:00.719Z,He just didn't make any effort to be able to make everyone feel comfortable and included. 
10,3,5e84cbb050f6e364321d6258,littleGoat,2020-04-21T20:32:04.855Z,"THe wife shouldn't have to make a choice and the mom is being accommodating as is, and he already knows ENglish. I suppose the least he can do is respect the rules of the house."

10,3,5e9de7129dc0406f898722c9,newGiraffe,2020-04-21T20:32:27.314Z,i agree
10,3,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e6,spryRabbit,2020-04-21T20:32:30.941Z,but the husband was unwilling to even try
10,3,5e84cbb050f6e364321d6258,littleGoat,2020-04-21T20:32:39.033Z,He can at least make the effort. Yes
10,3,5d482eab21c9be351f7641c0,smallPig,2020-04-21T20:32:40.020Z,So if the mother visted them in Germany would they still speak german??

10,3,5e31d6b2e31c5304c46f140a,culturedBison,2020-04-21T20:32:56.787Z,"Yes, its understandable that you might be shy since you don't know the language but no one will make fun of him for using the wrong words"

11,0,5e9f40129dc0406f89878121,littleBison,2020-04-21T19:24:56.795Z,in the scenario
11,0,5e9f0b249dc0406f89874b78,littleDonkey,2020-04-21T19:25:04.577Z,the husband could sacrifice some time to help her mom or better still pay fro a translation class for her

11,0,5e9f0b249dc0406f89874b78,littleDonkey,2020-04-21T19:26:26.751Z,well she should tell her husband to help out

11,1,5e9f40129dc0406f89878121,likelyBear,2020-04-21T19:39:50.491Z,a kinder person would be more calm and rational and communicative

12,0,5e9f37669dc0406f89877682,newRabbit,2020-04-21T19:07:02.616Z,I understand wanting to make your husband feel comforatble but to exclude his mom is wrong.

I think this scenario in particular is difficult because more than one person is involved. If I had to choose I do think the poster is an asshole. 
12,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763fa9,smallLion,2020-04-21T19:07:33.814Z,I feel like this person has some remorse over the decision but inevitably decided to be inflexible and please one person instead of compromise.

12,0,5e9f37669dc0406f89877682,newRabbit,2020-04-21T19:08:01.198Z,the husband could have participated in the conversation in english but the mother did not have that option

12,0,5e9f36e49dc0406f8987767c,conventionalRhino,2020-04-21T19:08:14.017Z,He could express to his husband that he will learn english better with practice

12,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764056,newCow,2020-04-21T19:08:54.948Z,Yeah good point! They are at the mom's house so they should definitely honor her language preference. 
12,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763fa9,smallLion,2020-04-21T19:09:04.627Z,I feel that this person is somewhere between asshole and not and needs to address it with both parties and find compromise

12,0,5e84ccaa50f6e364321d626c,likelyPig,2020-04-21T19:09:49.216Z,HE could have honored he by preparing her for the fact that he was going to be speaking german.
12,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764150,conventionalBison,2020-04-21T19:10:03.500Z,I think he is trapped between the two.

12,1,5e9f12369dc0406f8987514b,youngPig,2020-04-21T19:21:20.942Z,"I think she brought it up in a kind way, without being mean"
12,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fa9,niceDonkey,2020-04-21T19:21:22.716Z,I don't think she was an asshole. She maybe could have handled it better
12,1,5e9f37669dc0406f89877682,littleOrangutan,2020-04-21T19:21:24.780Z,I think she was wellmeaning and not the asshole at all
12,1,5e9f12369dc0406f8987514b,youngPig,2020-04-21T19:21:34.357Z,Not an asshole? What is everyones vote?
12,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764056,youngBison,2020-04-21T19:21:36.475Z,"I do not think the mom is an asshole either! I do think she could have asked them in a different way. Using the word ""disrespectful"" can trigger some people."
12,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764150,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-21T19:21:40.767Z,The word choice of it being disrespectful probably wasn’t the best.
12,1,5e84ccaa50f6e364321d626c,spryHippo,2020-04-21T19:21:43.432Z,I mdon't think the Mother is an asshole.  Different from the other scenerio because this one doesn't feel uncomfortable.  It says he speaks English just with an accent
12,1,5e9f36e49dc0406f8987767c,littleRabbit,2020-04-21T19:21:45.954Z,I feel more in the middle on this case. In a perfect world I guess she could've spoken to her son in private but overall she wasn't very rude
12,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fa9,niceDonkey,2020-04-21T19:21:50.596Z,She seemed abrasive to me but was within her right
12,1,5e9f12369dc0406f8987514b,youngPig,2020-04-21T19:22:03.367Z,"Not an asshole, just using possibly triggering words"
12,1,5e9f36e49dc0406f8987767c,littleRabbit,2020-04-21T19:22:17.211Z,I agree
12,1,5e84ccaa50f6e364321d626c,spryHippo,2020-04-21T19:22:22.156Z,He validated that he was the asshole when he went upstairs after she said something...rusde 
12,1,5e9f12369dc0406f8987514b,youngPig,2020-04-21T19:22:29.861Z,Ture
12,1,5e9f37669dc0406f89877682,littleOrangutan,2020-04-21T19:22:31.146Z, if the partner had the ability to speak english then he shoud have . the mom didnt have that option
12,1,5e9f12369dc0406f8987514b,youngPig,2020-04-21T19:22:32.211Z,true
12,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764150,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-21T19:22:34.475Z,Not an asshole but definitely poor choice of words. More tact may have helped.
12,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fa9,niceDonkey,2020-04-21T19:22:45.695Z,"There is the fact that no matter what, at least she was direct, expressed her needs and opinion and tried"
12,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fa9,niceDonkey,2020-04-21T19:23:01.693Z,"yeah. poor choice, agreed"
12,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fa9,niceDonkey,2020-04-21T19:23:05.748Z,not an asshole
12,1,5e9f36e49dc0406f8987767c,littleRabbit,2020-04-21T19:23:06.609Z,There's a lot of worse ways to act in the situation
12,1,5e9f36e49dc0406f8987767c,littleRabbit,2020-04-21T19:23:09.684Z,I vote not
12,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fa9,niceDonkey,2020-04-21T19:23:19.975Z,Good point
12,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fa9,niceDonkey,2020-04-21T19:23:27.230Z,I vote not
12,1,5e84ccaa50f6e364321d626c,spryHippo,2020-04-21T19:23:34.062Z,"Her delivery could have been better, but his actions could have been too.  I feel like he made an effort to show zero respect.  He could have said, ""ok."""
12,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764150,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-21T19:23:35.529Z,He was able to speak English so this was really a poor choice on their part. 
12,1,5e84ccaa50f6e364321d626c,spryHippo,2020-04-21T19:23:42.232Z,I vote NOT too
12,1,5e9f37669dc0406f89877682,littleOrangutan,2020-04-21T19:23:58.347Z,if i was sitiing around people talking that i could not understand i would be uncomfortable
12,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764150,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-21T19:23:59.876Z,I vote not an asshole.
12,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fa9,niceDonkey,2020-04-21T19:24:00.487Z,The German guy could speak English as well
12,1,5e84ccaa50f6e364321d626c,spryHippo,2020-04-21T19:24:22.025Z,"He could, but he didn't well and expressed that it made him uncomfortable"
12,1,5e84ccaa50f6e364321d626c,spryHippo,2020-04-21T19:24:41.675Z,"this guy didn't feel uncomfortable, but chose to make other uncomfortable"
12,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764150,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-21T19:24:44.760Z,I definitely looked at both sides. She was right just tacky.
12,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fa9,niceDonkey,2020-04-21T19:24:50.840Z,good point
12,1,5e9f36e49dc0406f8987767c,littleRabbit,2020-04-21T19:24:54.977Z,and it was the son not the spouse that posted last time
12,1,5e9f37669dc0406f89877682,littleOrangutan,2020-04-21T19:25:01.209Z,I understand being uncomfortable with a new language but at least he had the ability to the mom didnt
12,1,5e84ccaa50f6e364321d626c,spryHippo,2020-04-21T19:25:24.946Z,"Looking at both side, they could have both done better, but the 20 year old should display some type of respect"
12,1,5e9f36e49dc0406f8987767c,littleRabbit,2020-04-21T19:25:40.085Z,"yeah, you are a guest and need to take that into account"
12,1,5e9f37669dc0406f89877682,littleOrangutan,2020-04-21T19:25:49.046Z,true
12,1,5e84ccaa50f6e364321d626c,spryHippo,2020-04-21T19:26:03.907Z,Focusing on this scenario...Mom isn't an asshole
12,1,5e9f36e49dc0406f8987767c,littleRabbit,2020-04-21T19:26:12.613Z,I think we can all agree not an asshole here then? Whenever the vote comes
12,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764150,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-21T19:26:13.726Z,I think the German husband should have given his husband a break. I know. Unrelated.
12,1,5e9f37669dc0406f89877682,littleOrangutan,2020-04-21T19:26:20.985Z,no not an asshole

12,1,5e84ccaa50f6e364321d626c,spryHippo,2020-04-21T19:27:11.622Z,well said!

13,1,5e9f35ea9dc0406f89877613,likelyGoat,2020-04-21T19:04:19.949Z,I felt the same way as littleOrangutan but I still think he was an asshole
13,1,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225e,littleOrangutan,2020-04-21T19:04:26.153Z,"He did have a good point – well, many good points. It would help her feel more independent if she even knew broken English vs relying on a family member."
13,1,5e9f111e9dc0406f89874ff8,culturedMonkey,2020-04-21T19:04:28.635Z,my to

13,1,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,littleHippo,2020-04-21T19:04:47.696Z,"When he clarified how he worded it to his mother in law it changed my opinion. No, he is not an asshole!"
13,1,5e9f111e9dc0406f89874ff8,culturedMonkey,2020-04-21T19:04:47.958Z,yes he was
13,1,5e9f35ea9dc0406f89877613,likelyGoat,2020-04-21T19:04:51.439Z,It doesn't take much effort to help out his MIL why make such a big deal
13,1,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,littleHippo,2020-04-21T19:05:04.398Z,I am sure he has a life too!
13,1,5e9f0ade9dc0406f898749a7,likelyBison,2020-04-21T19:05:23.205Z,"Depending on how many times her MIL asked him for help, it can be difficult to cope with"
13,1,5e9f39d29dc0406f898777bf,smallWolf,2020-04-21T19:05:26.368Z,"My thoughts on it are he married into this family, so he can't really make them change."
13,1,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,littleHippo,2020-04-21T19:05:37.354Z,Have you ever had to translate for someone? Think about all the people you talk to in a day.

13,1,5e9f39d29dc0406f898777bf,smallWolf,2020-04-21T19:05:57.160Z,Unfortunately this is something he should have addressed before marrying into this family?

13,1,5e9f0ade9dc0406f898749a7,likelyBison,2020-04-21T19:06:04.722Z,"He has a fair point, however he cannot compared himself to his MIL"
13,1,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225e,littleOrangutan,2020-04-21T19:06:17.159Z,He is encouraging her to be more independent.
13,1,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225e,littleOrangutan,2020-04-21T19:06:25.701Z,"He wasn't asking that she learned English to communicate with him, rather to assist herself and avoid panic while in social situations alone (without a translator)."

13,1,5e9f35ea9dc0406f89877613,likelyGoat,2020-04-21T19:07:02.624Z,or maybe she doens't understand all the inuendos and slang 
13,1,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225e,littleOrangutan,2020-04-21T19:07:04.021Z,She's in a spanish speaking community though
13,1,5e9f39d29dc0406f898777bf,smallWolf,2020-04-21T19:07:06.998Z,How often is she having to go out without a family member though?
13,1,5e9f0ade9dc0406f898749a7,likelyBison,2020-04-21T19:07:07.023Z,Sometimes moving into another country is a forced choice

13,1,5e9f111e9dc0406f89874ff8,culturedMonkey,2020-04-21T19:08:05.331Z,i say yes
13,1,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,littleHippo,2020-04-21T19:08:09.982Z,He was being sincere in how he would help her learn English.
13,1,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225e,littleOrangutan,2020-04-21T19:08:26.562Z,She could be 50 years old not 90
13,1,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,littleHippo,2020-04-21T19:08:31.730Z,So
13,1,5e9f35ea9dc0406f89877613,likelyGoat,2020-04-21T19:08:43.760Z,"maybe he is being sincere, but he should still not cause a fuss and division in the family over something that probably doens't take up much time"

13,1,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,littleHippo,2020-04-21T19:09:17.057Z,Maybe he has helped so long and he is tired. That happens after doing something for so long for somebody!
13,1,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225e,littleOrangutan,2020-04-21T19:09:19.377Z,My comment was in response to likelyGoat about her age
13,1,5e9f35ea9dc0406f89877613,likelyGoat,2020-04-21T19:09:23.096Z,"first it will be this then it will be family dinners, and other traditions that his in-laws do"

13,2,5e9f0ade9dc0406f898749a7,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-21T19:19:03.007Z,Now we get to see the other point of view
13,2,5e9f39d29dc0406f898777bf,littleLion,2020-04-21T19:19:11.026Z,"My initial impression is she was not the asshole, but at the end I believe she is."
13,2,5e9f0ade9dc0406f898749a7,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-21T19:19:13.272Z,and I think she is an asshole.

13,2,5e9f39d29dc0406f898777bf,littleLion,2020-04-21T19:19:18.074Z,yes!
13,2,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,youngGoat,2020-04-21T19:19:24.201Z,No
13,2,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225e,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-21T19:19:24.708Z,She seems to be the asshole – she knows how much of a burden it can be to translate for her family since she's done it for years. She's putting a lot of pressure on her husband.
13,2,5e9f39d29dc0406f898777bf,littleLion,2020-04-21T19:19:39.562Z,"I understand she is busy with her Masters, but she needs to tell her Mom not to bypass her anymore."
13,2,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,youngGoat,2020-04-21T19:19:44.680Z,"Yes, I am sorry she is an asshole!"
13,2,5e9f0ade9dc0406f898749a7,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-21T19:19:45.407Z,You cannot expect from your husband to deal with something clearly do not want either.
13,2,5e9f35ea9dc0406f89877613,youngGiraffe,2020-04-21T19:19:56.252Z,i didn't think she was asshole. she was just venting
13,2,5e9f39d29dc0406f898777bf,littleLion,2020-04-21T19:19:57.977Z,It's not at all fair to her husband.
13,2,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225e,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-21T19:20:00.226Z,She even said that he's become the go-to for when her mother needs someone to translate.
13,2,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,youngGoat,2020-04-21T19:20:03.908Z,Do we all agree? Yes!
13,2,5e9f39d29dc0406f898777bf,littleLion,2020-04-21T19:20:12.402Z,Yes youngGoat
13,2,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225e,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-21T19:20:13.261Z,He was also venting and people jumped down his throat youn
13,2,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225e,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-21T19:20:32.173Z,He was also venting and people jumped down his throat youngGiraffe
13,2,5e9f39d29dc0406f898777bf,littleLion,2020-04-21T19:20:34.073Z,"he was venting, but he married into that family."
13,2,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,youngGoat,2020-04-21T19:20:34.105Z,He didn't learn Spanish to translate for future im-laws.
13,2,5e9f0ade9dc0406f898749a7,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-21T19:20:35.302Z,"His husband can have free time, but it does not mean he needs to invest all in her MIL"
13,2,5e9f39d29dc0406f898777bf,littleLion,2020-04-21T19:21:03.688Z,"this is her family, so really it's her responsibility."
13,2,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225e,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-21T19:21:11.948Z,I agree to all of the above.
13,2,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,youngGoat,2020-04-21T19:21:12.206Z,niceHippo what is your opinion?
13,2,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,youngGoat,2020-04-21T19:21:21.495Z,youngGiraffe
13,2,5e9f35ea9dc0406f89877613,youngGiraffe,2020-04-21T19:21:23.967Z,I really don't have a strong opinion on this one because it can go either way. 
13,2,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,youngGoat,2020-04-21T19:21:29.715Z,littleLion ?
13,2,5e9f39d29dc0406f898777bf,littleLion,2020-04-21T19:21:43.015Z,I vote she is the asshole.
13,2,5e9f0ade9dc0406f898749a7,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-21T19:21:52.528Z,"It depends on how you see, and if you have experience something similar."
13,2,5e9f0ade9dc0406f898749a7,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-21T19:22:03.744Z,"I have experienced it, and it is not easy."
13,2,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225e,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-21T19:22:21.480Z,conventionalSquirrel what are your thoughts then?
13,2,5e9f39d29dc0406f898777bf,littleLion,2020-04-21T19:22:24.903Z,I'm sure it's not. I'm not trying to downgrade this situation. It's just my thoughts/feelings.
13,2,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,youngGoat,2020-04-21T19:22:25.838Z,"He may have overreacted this one time but, he can't be expected to do it all the time in the future. And, that is what she is suggesting."
13,2,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225e,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-21T19:22:53.358Z,I totally agree youngGoat
13,2,5e9f0ade9dc0406f898749a7,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-21T19:23:02.241Z,"She should not be angry at him, she should help her husband too to deal with this situation"
13,2,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225e,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-21T19:23:04.842Z,Anyone have opposing opinions?
13,2,5e9f0ade9dc0406f898749a7,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-21T19:23:09.796Z,It is not a one person job.
13,2,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,youngGoat,2020-04-21T19:23:27.778Z,"No, I think we all agreed she is an asshole!"
13,2,5e9f0ade9dc0406f898749a7,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-21T19:23:33.995Z,Yes.
13,2,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225e,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-21T19:23:49.016Z,"Awesome, glad we got to see the other side of the previous story!"
13,2,5e9f39d29dc0406f898777bf,littleLion,2020-04-21T19:23:55.485Z,agreed!
13,2,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,youngGoat,2020-04-21T19:23:59.493Z,Yes!
13,2,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,youngGoat,2020-04-21T19:24:32.447Z,"On the other hand, you could say he knew when he married her that her parents didnt speak English and she was translating for them!!"
13,2,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225e,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-21T19:25:18.070Z,"True, I don't think he ever expected it to become his responsibility though. "
13,2,5e9f3a0e9dc0406f898777e7,youngGoat,2020-04-21T19:25:43.193Z,"She can not expect her husband to do what she has been doing. She has a point that her parents have worked hard to get here. And, that this country was made of immigrants."
14,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764242,likelyMonkey,2020-04-21T18:32:14.898Z,Hi everyone. I considered the edit area a lot when considering that he is not the asshole. 
14,0,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,conventionalHorse,2020-04-21T18:32:27.741Z,I think the guy is in the right asking his MIL to do for herself
14,0,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,conventionalHorse,2020-04-21T18:32:34.716Z,Yes I did as well
14,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764242,likelyMonkey,2020-04-21T18:32:42.024Z,"I feel like if he is offering to help her learn how to speak english so she can be independent is a good thing, as long as it was said with respect. "
14,0,5e9f36309dc0406f89877619,conventionalLion,2020-04-21T18:32:59.005Z,His post and his edit told very different stories. I went more with the original post because I felt like he could be editing to not seem like the bad guy.
14,0,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,conventionalHorse,2020-04-21T18:32:59.140Z,That is true
14,0,5e7e1e1431f4e454e196c310,youngGiraffe,2020-04-21T18:33:23.975Z,"I surprised myself by deciding he was the asshole, not because he asked her politely, but because he apparently failed to take into consideration where they live: in an area with mostly people of Mexican and Latin American descent."
14,0,5e8b38f636ec0e1294b35f12,smallGorilla,2020-04-21T18:33:30.557Z,it wasn't said with respect and that's what make him an asshole.
14,0,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,conventionalHorse,2020-04-21T18:33:31.370Z,But he could have just been venting in the post and not said it disrespectfully to his MIL
14,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763ec2,culturedCow,2020-04-21T18:33:45.486Z,"I do not consider that he is an asshole either, the reason for the discussion is something important and it is not at all selfish. I will only limit that his way of solving the situation if he was something idiotic. "
14,0,5e9f36309dc0406f89877619,conventionalLion,2020-04-21T18:33:46.716Z,"I don't think it's a bad idea to help her learn English, but he also can't make her do it."
14,0,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,conventionalHorse,2020-04-21T18:33:49.747Z,He said it in respect
14,0,5d482eab21c9be351f76409f,spryOrangutan,2020-04-21T18:33:54.963Z,I am having trouble deciding one way or another. There is nothing wrong with trying to help someone by offering to help them with resources to learn a new language. 
14,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764242,likelyMonkey,2020-04-21T18:33:56.780Z,The area at the bottom said that he did not speak to her that way as he did in the post. 
14,0,5d482eab21c9be351f76409f,spryOrangutan,2020-04-21T18:34:25.280Z,However telling someone you are being burdened by then instead of just saying you can't really help them as much anymore feels more like an asshole move. 
14,0,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,conventionalHorse,2020-04-21T18:34:25.330Z,So he didn't read the whole thing...
14,0,5e8b38f636ec0e1294b35f12,smallGorilla,2020-04-21T18:34:33.088Z,He meant well for his mother inlaw but he should be a little bit polite.
14,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763ec2,culturedCow,2020-04-21T18:34:33.398Z,He could simply give her an app on her cell phone that translates everything she says into English
14,0,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,conventionalHorse,2020-04-21T18:34:38.228Z,he didn't say that to her 
14,0,5e7e1e1431f4e454e196c310,youngGiraffe,2020-04-21T18:34:40.457Z,"Yeah, his edit took me from ""definitely the asshole"" to ""I still think he might be"" because of my reasons above."
14,0,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,conventionalHorse,2020-04-21T18:34:45.720Z,he was just venting online
14,0,5e9f36309dc0406f89877619,conventionalLion,2020-04-21T18:34:50.601Z,I think his motives for helping her learn English are pretty selfish too.
14,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764242,likelyMonkey,2020-04-21T18:35:15.064Z,"Also, considering he learned spanish to better be able to communicate with them, clearly he cares"
14,0,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,conventionalHorse,2020-04-21T18:35:21.531Z,"its not selfish, I wouldn't be able to spend ten minutes on the phone if I were at work "
14,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763ec2,culturedCow,2020-04-21T18:35:43.114Z,I say that his motives are valid but the methods used were not.
14,0,5e7e1e1431f4e454e196c310,youngGiraffe,2020-04-21T18:35:52.346Z,"True, he has made the effort to communicate with this in-laws and MIL in a language that they are comfortable with."
14,0,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,conventionalHorse,2020-04-21T18:36:08.048Z,"he was just venting online, and used different motives to explain it to her '"
14,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764242,likelyMonkey,2020-04-21T18:36:11.268Z,"Well that is why he put an edit section at the bottom, to clarify how he was not rude to her and offered help and resources"
14,0,5e9f36309dc0406f89877619,conventionalLion,2020-04-21T18:36:17.193Z,He doesn't have to answer his phone. It's ok to set boundaries.
14,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763ec2,culturedCow,2020-04-21T18:36:22.973Z,He cannot be her translator for life.
14,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764242,likelyMonkey,2020-04-21T18:36:25.727Z,Absolutely agree
14,0,5e8b38f636ec0e1294b35f12,smallGorilla,2020-04-21T18:36:28.744Z,"after considering both side, I have come to the conclusion that he is not an asshole because his motives are valid but he should be a little bit more polite."
14,0,5e7e1e1431f4e454e196c310,youngGiraffe,2020-04-21T18:36:37.459Z,"I think if he had made it clear he offered to help her, for her convenience, and not made it sound like he was forcing independence from him on her."
14,0,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,conventionalHorse,2020-04-21T18:36:42.009Z,if he didn't answer the phone he would catch hell from his wife
14,0,5d482eab21c9be351f76409f,spryOrangutan,2020-04-21T18:36:55.964Z,For him wanting her to stop relying on him as much is a perfectly valid reason but perhaps it was his focus on learning the language of the area that really made him come off as the asshole.
14,0,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,conventionalHorse,2020-04-21T18:36:58.720Z,he did make that clear
14,0,5e9f36309dc0406f89877619,conventionalLion,2020-04-21T18:37:04.519Z,"I'm also curious as to why the entire family is mad at him if he was polite. I want to believe he was, but I'm having a hard time."
14,0,5e7e1e1431f4e454e196c310,youngGiraffe,2020-04-21T18:37:13.003Z,"I think if he had made it clear he offered to help her, for her convenience, and not made it sound like he was forcing independence from him on her, he would not be the asshole."
14,0,5e9f36309dc0406f89877619,conventionalLion,2020-04-21T18:37:46.650Z,"I think he was partly an asshole. I would love to believe otherwise, but I'm not convinced."
14,0,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,conventionalHorse,2020-04-21T18:37:59.634Z,"this person is not an asshole, she has been here 8 years, it is time to learn the ""main"" language spoken in the country "
14,0,5e9f36949dc0406f89877625,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-21T18:38:11.548Z,I thin that he did his part in order to help out. He has a heart. He is not a complete asshole.
14,0,5d482eab21c9be351f76409f,spryOrangutan,2020-04-21T18:38:12.536Z,I think he was the asshole because people would always like to think they are polite but come off as anything but that.
14,0,5e7e1e1431f4e454e196c310,youngGiraffe,2020-04-21T18:38:18.812Z,"I think if he offered to teach his wife Spanish, that would be helpful. They could both serve as interpreters if needed. She should step up to the plate, also."
14,0,5e9f36949dc0406f89877625,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-21T18:38:32.526Z,A true asshole wouldnt do the things that he did
14,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763ec2,littlePig,2020-04-21T19:16:45.068Z,"Hello, I consider that she is being selfish by supposing that he should do that duty as a husband as she did it as a family duty that she put on herself."
14,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763ec2,littlePig,2020-04-21T19:16:59.634Z,"the husband only asks for consideration because it is no longer a spontaneous favor, it is a duty that is constantly placed on him."
14,3,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,likelyHorse,2020-04-21T19:17:10.625Z,I think he is not selfish and is rightfully saying so
14,3,5e9f36309dc0406f89877619,littleMonkey,2020-04-21T19:17:16.156Z,"yeah, if she doesn't have time to help, why does her husband always have to drop everything to help?"
14,3,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,likelyHorse,2020-04-21T19:17:39.001Z,I wouldn't be able to do that if I were at work
14,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76409f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-21T19:17:48.840Z,I would also consider the poster as the asshole as forcing the husband to do this without any consideration for his time is not cool.
14,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764242,youngGoat,2020-04-21T19:17:49.293Z,`I agree. I feel she is being a jerk. She could of course shoot him a text and see if he has time to help at the very least.
14,3,5e8b38f636ec0e1294b35f12,newRabbit,2020-04-21T19:18:05.319Z,"he is married to her so they her family, her parents are part of the family as well."
14,3,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,likelyHorse,2020-04-21T19:18:21.282Z,Yes.  I think the wife is just pawning off the duties onto him
14,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764242,youngGoat,2020-04-21T19:18:23.095Z,"You are not entitled to dictate the time of your family though, not even a spouse"
14,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763ec2,littlePig,2020-04-21T19:18:24.091Z,"I feel that she expresses her style ""I am productive and he is not, so he should do my family's duties in return"""
14,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76409f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-21T19:18:42.697Z,I get that the mother is also his family and there is a duty to help. But helping others kind of falls on the helper's time table. 
14,3,5e9f36309dc0406f89877619,littleMonkey,2020-04-21T19:18:44.489Z,"If the parents need help, they should also be considerate of other people and ask for help when someone is available, right?"
14,3,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,likelyHorse,2020-04-21T19:18:58.392Z,Men are not resources for throwing around
14,3,5e8b38f636ec0e1294b35f12,newRabbit,2020-04-21T19:19:00.203Z,I think the husband should be able to accept the responsibility
14,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764242,youngGoat,2020-04-21T19:19:34.391Z,I feel the biggest issue here is they are not being grateful and considerate but instead feel entitled because of the family card. There is a lack of respect for the husband. 
14,3,5e9f35fe9dc0406f89877614,likelyHorse,2020-04-21T19:19:34.678Z,"He can, but he was never asked the responsibility was forced on him"
14,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76409f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-21T19:19:37.067Z,The husband should help when able. But it is unreasonable to expect him to be able to do so at all hours. 
14,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763ec2,littlePig,2020-04-21T19:19:53.528Z,"I consider that he can accept to do it, but as a favor it is not a duty that he must constantly fulfill."

14,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76409f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-21T19:22:42.334Z,It feels like the wife is trying to pass on what she feels are her responsibilities on the husband.

15,0,5e9f14709dc0406f898754ab,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-21T18:26:03.857Z,He's not an asshole.  He might be lacking in social grace's and politeness maybe even patience but his feelings are his own and he justified them.  
15,0,5e9de51e9dc0406f8987225c,niceGorilla,2020-04-21T18:26:19.370Z,My initial expression was that he was an asshole. After completle reading it he does have it opinion on helping. A person is allowed to get frustrated. Maybe him not helping  would allow her to be less dependent and learn more english.
15,0,5e877a0ea44a3116d9b95d26,littlePig,2020-04-21T18:26:23.924Z,I don't think this person is an asshole. It's not his responsibility to stand by and help his mother in law at random times of the day. it does not make him a racist. Definitely could have been a little more polite.

15,0,5e877f2ca44a3116d9b95f1d,conventionalHippo,2020-04-21T18:26:56.853Z,he mother in-law is disrupting his daily life and it was good that he was honest with her respectfully.
15,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640ac,sprySquirrel,2020-04-21T18:27:09.451Z,Learning a language is extremely hard for some people. Not everyone learns the same or at the same pace so him saying that to his MIL is inconsiderate. He's an asshole for thinking his feelings are ok but he was polite about the situation.
15,0,5e877f2ca44a3116d9b95f1d,conventionalHippo,2020-04-21T18:27:31.307Z,"The edit said that he did not use the words ""i'm sick of this shit"" and he said he tried to be polite"
15,0,5e9f14709dc0406f898754ab,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-21T18:27:35.222Z,His language and attitude were irksome but when he adjusted his original writing to reflect his views more accurately it didn't seem like an asshole to me.
15,0,5e9debfe9dc0406f89872699,spryOrangutan,2020-04-21T18:27:35.915Z,I had mixed feelings about this scenario too. It would help if he or another family member would personally help her try to learn some parts of the language to help with every day tasks. She may not be comfortable going to ESL classes 
15,0,5e877a0ea44a3116d9b95d26,littlePig,2020-04-21T18:28:11.756Z,"I agree, he should provide some more hands on assistance to help her learn instead of suggesting apps and classes."
15,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640ac,sprySquirrel,2020-04-21T18:28:27.566Z,"I think the way he went about it is okay since he was polite, but he needs to re-think about his mother in law's position."
15,0,5e9f14709dc0406f898754ab,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-21T18:28:29.227Z,He offered to help from what I read.  He wants to help once instead of being relied upon forever.
15,0,5e877f2ca44a3116d9b95f1d,conventionalHippo,2020-04-21T18:28:33.631Z,That's true. And the fact that she has been in the US for 8 years may suggest that she tried to learn English but did not succeed.
15,0,5e877a68a44a3116d9b95d7b,smallCow,2020-04-21T18:28:46.990Z,"So we agree that he was justified in what he felt, and he tried to be polite.  So was he an asshole?"
15,0,5e877f2ca44a3116d9b95f1d,conventionalHippo,2020-04-21T18:29:11.860Z,I dont think he was an asshole
15,0,5e877a0ea44a3116d9b95d26,littlePig,2020-04-21T18:29:21.087Z,"No, I do not think he was an asshole."
15,0,5e877a68a44a3116d9b95d7b,smallCow,2020-04-21T18:29:35.486Z,"Okay, I'll say he was not an asshole."
15,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640ac,sprySquirrel,2020-04-21T18:29:42.059Z,I think he's an asshole for not being considerate ENOUGH. He should've thought about the whole situation from his mother in laws POV also before posting it online to strangers.
15,0,5e9ded209dc0406f898727ad,youngLion,2020-04-21T18:29:51.474Z,I think he was an asshole.
15,0,5e877f2ca44a3116d9b95f1d,conventionalHippo,2020-04-21T18:30:07.749Z,what were some ways he could have been more considerate spr

15,0,5e9ded209dc0406f898727ad,youngLion,2020-04-21T18:30:49.181Z,I think he absolutely is guilty of flaunting his white privedge.
15,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640ac,sprySquirrel,2020-04-21T18:30:52.390Z,Because some people can't learn another language as good as others because of many different factors.
15,0,5e877a68a44a3116d9b95d7b,smallCow,2020-04-21T18:31:05.510Z,He should have tried to consider her feelings and situation a little better and tried to help more.
15,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640ac,sprySquirrel,2020-04-21T18:31:08.482Z,I'm bilingual so I see it from both point of views.
15,0,5e9ded209dc0406f898727ad,youngLion,2020-04-21T18:31:09.139Z,I think the tone he used helped convince me of him being an asshole.
15,0,5e9ded209dc0406f898727ad,youngLion,2020-04-21T18:31:36.857Z,I think his edits at the end are insincere and innacurate.
15,2,5e9ded209dc0406f898727ad,culturedRhino,2020-04-21T18:55:09.668Z,My initial reaction is that she is not an asshole.

15,2,5e877a68a44a3116d9b95d7b,niceHippo,2020-04-21T18:55:43.778Z,"I believe immigrants should learn the language of the country they go to.  And if he is getting all upset about doing it, she should not make him."

15,2,5e9ded209dc0406f898727ad,culturedRhino,2020-04-21T18:56:31.389Z,"He should share her values as her husband, and he should help her family when she is too busy."
15,2,5e877f2ca44a3116d9b95f1d,spryHorse,2020-04-21T18:56:55.021Z,I agree that they should try to learn the language but it is not as easy as it is made out to be even with those language learning resources
15,2,5d482eab21c9be351f7640ac,conventionalLion,2020-04-21T18:57:18.989Z,She is not an asshole because she is completely right about this whole situation regarding the fact that her parents are immigrants and have worked really hard for her.
15,2,5e877a0ea44a3116d9b95d26,snappyBear,2020-04-21T18:57:29.587Z,Definitely not easy to learn a language and especially at an older age. 
15,2,5e9ded209dc0406f898727ad,culturedRhino,2020-04-21T18:57:49.450Z,"He had the privledge to learn the language in school when it is exponentially easier than as an adult. Now, he is unreasonably asking that they learn what he learned without the same resources."
15,2,5d482eab21c9be351f7640ac,conventionalLion,2020-04-21T18:57:52.189Z,Learning languages is not easy specially at an older age. And when you are constantly working there is barely any time to practice a new language.
15,2,5e877a68a44a3116d9b95d7b,niceHippo,2020-04-21T18:58:26.430Z,"They should speak English at home, instead of always going to Spanish."

15,2,5e877a0ea44a3116d9b95d26,snappyBear,2020-04-21T18:58:41.209Z,You should always lend a helping hand to family when you are able to. 
15,2,5e9ded209dc0406f898727ad,culturedRhino,2020-04-21T18:59:19.236Z,She is not the asshole for asking her husband to occasionally help her mother.
15,2,5d482eab21c9be351f7640ac,conventionalLion,2020-04-21T18:59:46.720Z,The husband should be grateful that his wife's parents were even able to come to this country in the first place since they migrated.

16,1,5ea077a29dc0406f8987e162,smallPig,2020-04-22T18:00:44.520Z,I think more than anything this is a generational/ cultural issue. My mother in law expects my husband and his siblings to just drop everything and do what she says 
16,1,5e9f36449dc0406f8987761b,youngDonkey,2020-04-22T18:00:51.263Z,I dont think him as racist also.
16,1,5ea079969dc0406f8987ea64,culturedHippo,2020-04-22T18:01:00.411Z,My first impression is that this guy is an asshole. It's clear that he's frustrated and then way he explains himself by the way he's complaining and venting about the situation
16,1,5ea0740a9dc0406f8987d411,youngPanda,2020-04-22T18:01:09.869Z,I agree with both of these points. I think he was coming from the right place and a desire to help. He was a little aggressive at the end of the post though.
16,1,5ea077a29dc0406f8987e162,smallPig,2020-04-22T18:01:10.757Z,I don’t think he’s an asshole or racist

16,1,5e9f36449dc0406f8987761b,youngDonkey,2020-04-22T18:01:28.065Z,Language is the problem in this context.Its his wish to make his mother-in-law to learn english.
16,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763813,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-22T18:01:32.270Z,as well as the customes
16,1,5ea0740a9dc0406f8987d411,youngPanda,2020-04-22T18:01:47.872Z,Yeah I don't think he is racist at all
16,1,5e9f36449dc0406f8987761b,youngDonkey,2020-04-22T18:01:50.670Z,I dont think any problem with that person.

16,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763813,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-22T18:02:17.171Z,She would if she had someone helping her along
16,1,5e9f36449dc0406f8987761b,youngDonkey,2020-04-22T18:02:17.671Z,Its his own believes which made him to do so.
16,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763607,newWolf,2020-04-22T18:02:20.761Z,One consideration I think is maybe her age - perhaps it's easier for him to learn than it will be for her. Though she could definitely try!
16,1,5ea077a29dc0406f8987e162,smallPig,2020-04-22T18:02:35.914Z,I think her age is a huge part of this

16,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763813,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-22T18:03:00.618Z,thats true but considering my age I have learned enough Spanish to at least make what I am saying known
16,1,5ea079969dc0406f8987ea64,culturedHippo,2020-04-22T18:03:05.368Z,"He may be doing and saying the right things to her, but his attitude about it seems a bit asshole-ish to me."
16,1,5e9f36449dc0406f8987761b,youngDonkey,2020-04-22T18:03:15.326Z,Its difficult for her to learn english in this older age.But she might put an affort on this if she likes learning it.
16,1,5ea077a29dc0406f8987e162,smallPig,2020-04-22T18:03:23.531Z,He offered to help her and gave her resources. You can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink
16,1,5e9f36449dc0406f8987761b,youngDonkey,2020-04-22T18:03:47.140Z,I am telling both the sides.what i feel regarding the both sides.
16,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763813,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-22T18:03:50.505Z,Just look at how others in the family would feel if she should the initiative the kids would be inspired by her
16,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763607,newWolf,2020-04-22T18:03:53.564Z,"That's true, but there also isn't any indication that he has raised the point before."
16,1,5ea0740a9dc0406f8987d411,youngPanda,2020-04-22T18:03:54.782Z,So it seems like we are in agreement? Does anyone think he is the asshole?
16,1,5ea077a29dc0406f8987e162,smallPig,2020-04-22T18:03:55.197Z,"When I say age is a factor, I mean mindset. Generational beliefs and customs "
16,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763607,newWolf,2020-04-22T18:04:00.026Z,Or that he's tried to help her learn before

16,1,5ea079969dc0406f8987ea64,culturedHippo,2020-04-22T18:05:58.756Z,"I recognize the same attitude with myself. I internally judge someone, expect them to be like me. But to them he's being fake with how he really feels. How he really feels is how he's expressing it ""Dealing with her shit"". "
16,1,5ea079969dc0406f8987ea64,culturedHippo,2020-04-22T18:05:59.909Z,That's how I internally talk to myself and judge others and I call that my inner asshole
16,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763813,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-22T18:06:19.164Z,Seems he was trying to be helpful and loving and was very misjudged.  He is not an asshole.  
16,1,5ea0740a9dc0406f8987d411,youngPanda,2020-04-22T18:06:25.967Z,"The person was trying to help his mother-in-law and was not being antagonistic. He may be an ""internal asshole"" but his actions are not outwardly reflecting that."
16,2,5e9f36449dc0406f8987761b,niceHorse,2020-04-22T18:15:13.951Z,i dont think the person as an asshole
16,2,5ea077a29dc0406f8987e162,smallGoat,2020-04-22T18:15:28.287Z,I understand she wants her husband to help out but it’s HER parents. If they have lived here that long they’ve should’ve learned enough English to get around. 
16,2,5ea079969dc0406f8987ea64,spryLion,2020-04-22T18:15:33.777Z,I think they're both assholes. They both are shit attitudes and complain and bitch about it instead of communicating about how they really feel.
16,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763813,culturedBison,2020-04-22T18:15:48.319Z,"My thought is that she is wrong for making her husband take the calls,  Sharing the responsibility is one thing But forcing the issue is another"

16,2,5ea077a29dc0406f8987e162,smallGoat,2020-04-22T18:16:11.021Z,She makes fun of her husbands Spanish but expects him to translate for her parents
16,2,5ea0740a9dc0406f8987d411,newDonkey,2020-04-22T18:16:19.720Z,I think both parties are kind of to blame here. I am leaning towards her being the asshole though because of the expectation he can always translate for her mother
16,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763813,culturedBison,2020-04-22T18:16:20.727Z,Herparents could have learned some basic English from the beginning {like maybe when her and her siblings were in school}
16,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763607,newRhino,2020-04-22T18:16:24.414Z,"I don't think it's wrong to ask him for help, but it seems like they could work together to figure out a solution instead of an all or nothing"
16,2,5e9f36449dc0406f8987761b,niceHorse,2020-04-22T18:16:25.669Z,i understand that she just want his husband ti consider her mom as his own mom.
16,2,5ea079969dc0406f8987ea64,spryLion,2020-04-22T18:16:31.001Z,She could definitely handle the situation a lot better than she is. And so could he.
16,2,5ea079969dc0406f8987ea64,spryLion,2020-04-22T18:16:51.747Z,They should get counseling and do some personal development. 
16,2,5ea077a29dc0406f8987e162,smallGoat,2020-04-22T18:16:52.231Z,Forcing him to talk the calls is ridiculous 
16,2,5e9f36449dc0406f8987761b,niceHorse,2020-04-22T18:16:57.455Z,as he knows spanish shw wish that he can translate it to spanish
16,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763813,culturedBison,2020-04-22T18:17:05.592Z,"Also why did she decided to be the one to tend the family, I mean her siblings should and most likely could step up also"
16,2,5ea077a29dc0406f8987e162,smallGoat,2020-04-22T18:17:23.195Z,Siblings could totally step up and help
16,2,5ea0740a9dc0406f8987d411,newDonkey,2020-04-22T18:17:24.031Z,I think that's a really important point ^^
16,2,5e9f36449dc0406f8987761b,niceHorse,2020-04-22T18:17:41.801Z,ya siblings can help
16,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763813,culturedBison,2020-04-22T18:17:45.238Z,I personally feel she is being an asshole
16,2,5ea0740a9dc0406f8987d411,newDonkey,2020-04-22T18:17:52.724Z,Can't they at least divide the responsibility among the husband and the siblings?
16,2,5ea079969dc0406f8987ea64,spryLion,2020-04-22T18:17:56.308Z,"I live in a community where we practice owning up our shit. Instead of being victims in our lives and placing blame on others, to take responsibility. Aligning thoughts words and actions in one's life"

16,2,5ea0740a9dc0406f8987d411,newDonkey,2020-04-22T18:18:43.195Z,I think he can definitely help but should not be expected to always be able to do so. I vote yes
16,2,5ea077a29dc0406f8987e162,smallGoat,2020-04-22T18:18:43.500Z,I vote she’s the asshole

16,2,5e9f36449dc0406f8987761b,niceHorse,2020-04-22T18:18:55.674Z,i vote that she is an asshole
16,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763607,newRhino,2020-04-22T18:19:05.607Z,I feel like there's too much responsibility on both sides
16,2,5e9f36449dc0406f8987761b,niceHorse,2020-04-22T18:19:20.813Z,equal responsibilty for both sides
16,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763813,culturedBison,2020-04-22T18:19:21.423Z,new newRhino what is the basis' for the lean? 
16,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763813,culturedBison,2020-04-22T18:19:57.971Z,The parents needed to take on some responsibility the spouse should want to help but the wife should not dictate to him 
16,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763607,newRhino,2020-04-22T18:20:06.457Z,"I think they both have responsibility for how this turned out, and it seems like neither of them are communicating"
16,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763813,culturedBison,2020-04-22T18:20:34.283Z,That maybe true but I only say what she was saying he did not type up anything it was just her view
16,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763607,newRhino,2020-04-22T18:20:37.344Z,"I don't disagree that the parent(s) should learn, but I don't think that should factor into the discussion about the wife/husband responsibility as much"
16,2,5ea0740a9dc0406f8987d411,newDonkey,2020-04-22T18:20:50.375Z,I think she is but I respect that perspective
16,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763813,culturedBison,2020-04-22T18:20:59.115Z,I think she is also
16,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763607,newRhino,2020-04-22T18:20:59.705Z,That's true too! Hearing only one side is not great
16,2,5e9f36449dc0406f8987761b,niceHorse,2020-04-22T18:21:20.334Z,person is an asshole.we cannot force our parents to learn a particular language
16,2,5ea077a29dc0406f8987e162,smallGoat,2020-04-22T18:21:30.906Z,I don’t do things just because my husband tells me to....
16,2,5e9f36449dc0406f8987761b,niceHorse,2020-04-22T18:21:35.861Z,its difficult to learn language in older age
17,0,5e543be4d1db96705ff13dc6,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-22T17:28:22.418Z,My initial thought is that the daughter is not wrong. 
17,0,5e9f4c929dc0406f89879f11,newHippo,2020-04-22T17:28:33.330Z,i am with you
17,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763e76,youngPanda,2020-04-22T17:28:46.733Z,I don't think she is wrong either
17,0,5e543be4d1db96705ff13dc6,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-22T17:28:48.658Z,Her husband should be able to help out since it's his in-laws and it is helping his wife out by helping them.
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763800,newLion,2020-04-22T17:28:48.764Z,I can understand where the husband is coming from. 
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763704,snappyBison,2020-04-22T17:28:52.375Z,I'm not sure 
17,0,5e9f4c929dc0406f89879f11,newHippo,2020-04-22T17:28:56.876Z,At the most if the husband is busy he can simply ask mom to call back in an hour
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763800,newLion,2020-04-22T17:29:01.081Z,It's no longer a favor but an expectation. 
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763704,snappyBison,2020-04-22T17:29:07.806Z,I can see both sides
17,0,5ea076809dc0406f8987dd98,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-22T17:29:09.441Z,"I totally get why the husband would be upset because he probably feels like he is taking on all of that responsibility of  translating. But he also married her, and it is his family too as she said. "
17,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763e76,youngPanda,2020-04-22T17:29:12.459Z,I'm with you newHi
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T17:29:18.090Z,A nation of immigrants doesn't mean a nation where you can go your whole life without learning the language of the other 85%. 
17,0,5ea076809dc0406f8987dd98,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-22T17:29:22.849Z,He also isn't doing anything so why can't he just help them for a couple minutes.
17,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763e76,youngPanda,2020-04-22T17:29:29.403Z,newHippo I agree
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7637ac,littleRabbit,2020-04-22T17:29:33.791Z,"While I understand the husband's annoyance, I don't think she is wrong."
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763704,snappyBison,2020-04-22T17:29:37.983Z,They should learn the language
17,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b3,likelyGoat,2020-04-22T17:29:39.497Z,"I can slightly see both sides as well. If the calls are excessive, I can see why the husband is getting frustrated"
17,0,5e9f4c929dc0406f89879f11,newHippo,2020-04-22T17:29:42.198Z,Exactly he has time
17,0,5e543be4d1db96705ff13dc6,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-22T17:29:48.283Z,It would put more stress on her to have to deal with it - so he's helping his wife more on this
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T17:29:56.091Z,"Plus, we don't know how long they've been in the US. Anything more than like four years is too long to not know passing English, even just reading."
17,0,5e9f4c929dc0406f89879f11,newHippo,2020-04-22T17:30:08.510Z,You are helping your wife and her parents deal with it for a while 
17,0,5ea076809dc0406f8987dd98,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-22T17:30:14.961Z,"I can see if they are excessive, but I mean it doesn't seem like it was by the article, and also it is his family. I help my family when they need help no matter what time it is."
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763704,snappyBison,2020-04-22T17:30:17.365Z,They should learn the language but the husband should help them
17,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b3,likelyGoat,2020-04-22T17:30:21.744Z,I think the husband was a bit snappy. he should have more sympathy and understanding since he is part of the family now. and has been throughout the years
17,0,5e543be4d1db96705ff13dc6,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-22T17:30:44.628Z,"and even though it should be the official language of the US, it's not yet"
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T17:30:46.185Z,"But the husband shouldn't have to, that's why he's not the asshole. I will help my in-laws, but not everyday forever just because that's the way they do it."
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763800,newLion,2020-04-22T17:30:57.295Z,I do think there are a lot of resources to learn english.
17,0,5ea076809dc0406f8987dd98,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-22T17:31:00.197Z,"I also don't like that he threw in they should learn english by using other means, I felt that was rude and unnecessary. "

17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T17:31:09.776Z,"Like, for instance, the very things they're trying to make him translate."
17,0,5e543be4d1db96705ff13dc6,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-22T17:31:10.746Z,"My husband knows more about computers than I do so when my parents need help, he helps - seems basic"
17,0,5e9f4c929dc0406f89879f11,newHippo,2020-04-22T17:31:11.594Z,This is the way he needs to help support his wife at the moment. Do it. They are not asking him to go to war. 10 minutes to translate somehing 
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T17:31:16.008Z,"We have the same letters, just learn them."

17,0,5ea076809dc0406f8987dd98,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-22T17:31:23.139Z,I help my in laws no matter when they need help. They're my family too.
17,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763e76,youngPanda,2020-04-22T17:31:33.218Z,"I dont think the husband should HAVE to but, yeah its not too much to ask"
17,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b3,likelyGoat,2020-04-22T17:31:33.965Z,I feel that they should all sit down together and discuss this situation openly and honestly. 
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763800,newLion,2020-04-22T17:31:37.411Z,"I think he hit a nerve, insinuating that they had the resources to drop everything to learn English."
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7637ac,littleRabbit,2020-04-22T17:31:45.903Z,And the fact is that he chose to marry into the family.
17,0,5e543be4d1db96705ff13dc6,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-22T17:31:47.434Z,"yeah, he did hit a nerve...."
17,0,5e543be4d1db96705ff13dc6,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-22T17:31:55.749Z,i agree likelyGoat that they should talk this through as a group
17,0,5e543be4d1db96705ff13dc6,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-22T17:32:06.466Z,maybe they can come to a compromise
17,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b3,likelyGoat,2020-04-22T17:32:10.824Z,"The wife should not expect her husband to do to certain things that he may not want to do, however, he should be more tactful about saying no. "
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763704,snappyBison,2020-04-22T17:32:21.883Z,"The husband should help his inlaws, but they should try to help by learning the language."

17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7637ac,littleRabbit,2020-04-22T17:32:38.597Z,A compromise would definitely  lead to the best result.

17,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b3,likelyGoat,2020-04-22T17:33:27.671Z,He should have known what he was getting himself into when they got married. I am sure he was helping them during the courtship phase. 
17,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763e76,youngPanda,2020-04-22T17:33:29.925Z,They really should talk it out. neither is the A here
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T17:33:35.055Z,I would disagree. I think she's more the asshole because she thinks he's privileged by wanting her old parents to learn the language of the country they're in. 
17,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7637ac,littleRabbit,2020-04-22T17:33:55.142Z,"Even though she could have dealt with the situation differently, she's not TA."
17,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b3,likelyGoat,2020-04-22T17:34:19.413Z,I completely agree with the comment above. 
17,0,5ea076809dc0406f8987dd98,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-22T17:34:23.286Z,"It is my opinion that she is not an asshole. I think she is just trying to help her family, and he is part of her family now. I think there needs to be a discussion of how to make it work better, but she still is not the asshole."
17,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b3,likelyGoat,2020-04-22T17:34:37.925Z,He is clearly the asshole
17,1,5ea076809dc0406f8987dd98,smallRhino,2020-04-22T17:43:13.483Z,My initial impression is that he is the asshole. 
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,newPanda,2020-04-22T17:43:15.382Z,"Still not the asshole. They've been in the US eight years, that's ample time to learn at least how to read."
17,1,5e543be4d1db96705ff13dc6,smallBison,2020-04-22T17:43:24.549Z,"Initially, I don't think he's a jerk. I did at first but then he explained himself"
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763800,snappyCow,2020-04-22T17:43:25.419Z,"I think the son-in law is being reasonable, but his tone makes him sound like an asshole."
17,1,5e9f4c929dc0406f89879f11,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T17:43:29.154Z,I´m on the other end
17,1,5e543be4d1db96705ff13dc6,smallBison,2020-04-22T17:43:39.883Z,he did seem jerky at first but then explained it in his EDIT
17,1,5ea076809dc0406f8987dd98,smallRhino,2020-04-22T17:43:40.877Z,I agree his tone does make him seem like an asshole.
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,newPanda,2020-04-22T17:43:42.965Z,"Yeah, but you're allowed to swear on the internet. All he did was show his irritation on a reddit post."
17,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e76,littleWolf,2020-04-22T17:43:48.087Z,I can see where he is coming from now.
17,1,5ea076809dc0406f8987dd98,smallRhino,2020-04-22T17:43:58.544Z,I totally understand that they have been here 8 years and get they probably should be able to learn it by now.
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763800,snappyCow,2020-04-22T17:44:01.535Z,"He did give her resources, and he's trying to help her to learn."
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,newPanda,2020-04-22T17:44:02.868Z,Eight whole years that they've failed to pick up anything at all.
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763800,snappyCow,2020-04-22T17:44:09.023Z,"At the same time, maybe that's very difficult for her."
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637ac,niceGoat,2020-04-22T17:44:11.444Z,"If he's telling the truth that when speaking to them he was polite, that changes things."
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763704,niceDonkey,2020-04-22T17:44:12.049Z,no i don't think the guy is the ahole. The parents need to learn to speak the language. But until they do he needs to help the best he can
17,1,5e9f4c929dc0406f89879f11,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T17:44:12.164Z,he comes off as a little rude but not an asshole in terms of his actions
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,newPanda,2020-04-22T17:44:13.053Z,"I would be annoyed as hell too, he seems like a good guy."
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763800,snappyCow,2020-04-22T17:44:19.383Z,"Regardless, there's a breakdown and all parties need to talk and set expectations."
17,1,5ea076809dc0406f8987dd98,smallRhino,2020-04-22T17:44:25.742Z,"But I also don't really think he handled it right, and maybe should have went with all the family together in order to speak with them about learning english."
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763704,niceDonkey,2020-04-22T17:44:37.715Z,The parents need to make an effort here
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763800,snappyCow,2020-04-22T17:44:38.406Z,"He does come off as an ahole in comparing himself to her, in terms of his ability to learn all these other languages. "
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,newPanda,2020-04-22T17:44:39.468Z,But now this guy is getting it from all sides that he shouldn't expect any work from his in-laws
17,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e76,littleWolf,2020-04-22T17:44:40.031Z,but at the same time just because something is easy for you to do doesn't mean it is easy for someone else.
17,1,5e9f4c929dc0406f89879f11,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T17:44:45.376Z,If he´s willing to devote time and effort to helping her learn and she´s just unwilling... I can´t call him an asshole
17,1,5e543be4d1db96705ff13dc6,smallBison,2020-04-22T17:44:47.405Z,"Yeah, i think talking it through with his wife first would have been helpful too"
17,1,5e543be4d1db96705ff13dc6,smallBison,2020-04-22T17:44:52.267Z,before he talked to the MIL
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637ac,niceGoat,2020-04-22T17:44:55.382Z,I definitely agree that he could have handled the situation better.
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,newPanda,2020-04-22T17:45:02.229Z,"I mean yeah, talking with your wife is a good first step but he's a reasonable guy."
17,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e76,littleWolf,2020-04-22T17:45:04.614Z,smallRhino Thats true
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763704,niceDonkey,2020-04-22T17:45:09.211Z,"He should speak to them in english, to help them learn"
17,1,5ea076809dc0406f8987dd98,smallRhino,2020-04-22T17:45:35.557Z,"I think comparing his ability to learn and hers was rude. She may have learning issues, or who knows what that makes it more difficult for her."
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,newPanda,2020-04-22T17:45:39.109Z,Just because something is more difficult for someone else doesn't mean they shouldn't still be expected to do it. 
17,1,5e9f4c929dc0406f89879f11,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T17:45:41.387Z,niceDonkey according to him he´s offered to help and passed along apps and information
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763704,niceDonkey,2020-04-22T17:45:45.450Z,The whole family should help them learn to speak English
17,1,5e543be4d1db96705ff13dc6,smallBison,2020-04-22T17:46:00.955Z,yeah comparing how quickly he learns languages isn't fair
17,1,5e543be4d1db96705ff13dc6,smallBison,2020-04-22T17:46:06.204Z,i don't think i could do it so easily
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,newPanda,2020-04-22T17:46:08.110Z,after eight years it really just seems like they're lazy with regards to learning english.
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763800,snappyCow,2020-04-22T17:46:12.323Z,"I agree, all hands on deck instead of it being about only the husband. "
17,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e76,littleWolf,2020-04-22T17:46:13.223Z,he was pretty rude to assume that because he learned 2 languages that she can do it too
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,newPanda,2020-04-22T17:46:15.235Z,but after eight years you'd be able to do something right?
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763800,snappyCow,2020-04-22T17:46:24.413Z,"Maybe, they are not used to learning as easily as he is."
17,1,5ea076809dc0406f8987dd98,smallRhino,2020-04-22T17:46:26.553Z,"I do think it's good he's offering to help. I think just the initial approach was a little rude, but his edit did make it a little better."
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,newPanda,2020-04-22T17:46:31.060Z,They aren't used to learning?
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637ac,niceGoat,2020-04-22T17:46:34.370Z,"Regardless of the specific English issue, I don't think it's too much to ask of him to help out once in a while."
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,newPanda,2020-04-22T17:46:38.797Z,"They're humans. They can do it, they just aren't."
17,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e76,littleWolf,2020-04-22T17:46:44.554Z,Yeah I like that he offered to help
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763800,snappyCow,2020-04-22T17:46:53.905Z,"What I mean is, in their country, maybe they don't have access to the learning resources that we have in America."
17,1,5e543be4d1db96705ff13dc6,smallBison,2020-04-22T17:46:57.766Z,"so yeah...i think as of now, not an ahole"
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637ac,niceGoat,2020-04-22T17:47:01.521Z,I guess it really depends how time-consuming this is for him.
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,newPanda,2020-04-22T17:47:14.091Z,In their country? they're in the US now.
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,newPanda,2020-04-22T17:47:24.118Z,If they can't figure out duolingo that he provided that's on them.
17,1,5ea076809dc0406f8987dd98,smallRhino,2020-04-22T17:47:27.200Z,"I agree niceGoat How often is this happening, and is it excessive."
17,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e76,littleWolf,2020-04-22T17:47:29.688Z,He didn't just say go learn English. he said here are some tools and I can help.
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763800,snappyCow,2020-04-22T17:47:31.658Z,"I know, but their foundation was formed in the country they were born in."
17,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e76,littleWolf,2020-04-22T17:47:35.420Z,Not the Ahole
17,1,5e543be4d1db96705ff13dc6,smallBison,2020-04-22T17:47:37.660Z,yes i a gree snappyCow
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763704,niceDonkey,2020-04-22T17:47:42.708Z,not an ahole
17,1,5ea076809dc0406f8987dd98,smallRhino,2020-04-22T17:47:55.142Z,"I am starting to think he's not really an asshole. Do I agree completely no, but think he really is just trying to help them"
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763619,newPanda,2020-04-22T17:48:08.073Z,"Oh my lord. If I moved to Japan what is the expectation there? You have to adapt, especially after eight years. Inexcusable. "
17,1,5e9f4c929dc0406f89879f11,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T17:48:12.976Z,slightly rude maybe but not an asshole
17,1,5ea076809dc0406f8987dd98,smallRhino,2020-04-22T17:49:00.340Z,"I don't think he's an asshole in the end. I think he is trying to help, but maybe just could've approached it better. "
17,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637ac,niceGoat,2020-04-22T17:49:25.348Z,"In the context of this sub, the way he went about it qualifies him as TA."
17,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e76,littleWolf,2020-04-22T17:49:38.787Z,Yep I think he was just getting tired of having to translate in the middle of his day and found a solution to help everyone.
18,0,5ea0720c9dc0406f8987ce48,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T17:01:57.715Z,hi
18,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f76396d,newRhino,2020-04-22T17:02:10.401Z,Hey!
18,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7636ad,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T17:02:19.733Z,"Since it is the mother's house, she can ask the guests to behave in a way that makes her comfortable"
18,0,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyCow,2020-04-22T17:02:21.044Z,I think this person is not an asshole because if they are all sitting in the same room as a family they should communicate in the same language with each other.
18,0,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyCow,2020-04-22T17:02:37.788Z,I think this person has the right to know what is being discussed in her own home
18,0,5ea0720c9dc0406f8987ce48,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T17:02:44.367Z,I think that the son and his partner were being very inconsiderate
18,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7636ad,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T17:02:46.003Z,"If the guests cannot conform to her requests, they should consider staying in another location"
18,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f76396d,newRhino,2020-04-22T17:03:04.959Z,I agree however I think the person could have said it in a better manner
18,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a74,smallMonkey,2020-04-22T17:03:06.587Z,I think the son and his mate are the assholes. It is really rude to not include everyone in conversations.
18,0,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyCow,2020-04-22T17:03:21.089Z,I agree! The son's partner was an asshole by immediately going upstairs instead of analyszing the situation.
18,0,5ea0720c9dc0406f8987ce48,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T17:03:21.982Z,They were staying at her house. And it's not like they can't speak English.
18,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7636ad,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T17:03:38.791Z,It was difficult to tell from the passage if the mother likes/approves of her son's partner.
18,0,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyCow,2020-04-22T17:03:52.770Z,It is possible that they were not saying anything rude. But they should have at least made her feel included.
18,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a74,smallMonkey,2020-04-22T17:04:03.744Z,Well she probably likes him less because of his behavior.
18,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7636ad,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T17:04:28.908Z,i think it was a small enough request that the son and his partner can accommodate the mother with little effort.  I think the son was making it into a bigger deal than it was
18,0,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyCow,2020-04-22T17:04:35.588Z,newRhino did you think the person was an asshole?
18,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f76396d,newRhino,2020-04-22T17:04:49.755Z,"Yes, I agree that this person was the asshole"
18,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a74,smallMonkey,2020-04-22T17:04:55.976Z,Do we all agree that the son is the asshole.
18,0,5ea0720c9dc0406f8987ce48,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T17:05:01.193Z,"The prompt says that she told them in a ""nice manner""."
18,0,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyCow,2020-04-22T17:05:02.605Z,seems like we all agree.
18,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7636ad,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T17:05:31.759Z,I would agree that the mother is not an asshole.  I'm not sure if we are to determine whether the son is.
18,0,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyCow,2020-04-22T17:05:36.562Z,oh i read that wrong
18,0,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyCow,2020-04-22T17:05:45.110Z,I agree that she is not an asshole
18,0,5ea0720c9dc0406f8987ce48,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T17:05:47.295Z,"The mother is definitely not an asshole, in my opinion."
18,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f76396d,newRhino,2020-04-22T17:06:02.217Z,I typed that wrong. I agree with everyone
18,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f76396d,newRhino,2020-04-22T17:06:08.163Z,the mother was not an asshole
18,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7636ad,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T17:06:11.451Z,it seems like we all agree
18,0,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyCow,2020-04-22T17:06:13.741Z,lol
18,0,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyCow,2020-04-22T17:06:53.611Z,do we have to say that we all agree or anything like that?
18,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763783,likelyHorse,2020-04-22T17:06:55.146Z,i agree
18,0,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyCow,2020-04-22T17:07:00.344Z,or do we just wait for the next page
18,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7636ad,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T17:07:54.275Z,The mother is not an asshole because it is her house and she was being made uncomfortable.  She asked in a kindly manner for the son and his partner to speak English.  This is not an unreasonble request.
18,0,5ea0720c9dc0406f8987ce48,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T17:07:54.735Z,"Ok, so I guess we all decided that she's not an asshole."
18,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a74,smallMonkey,2020-04-22T17:08:15.849Z,The mother is not the asshole the son is however he needs to grow up and be more sensitive to his mother.

18,3,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T17:46:55.126Z,I personally think this person is an asshole for not involving everyone in the conversation.
18,3,5d482ea921c9be351f763783,newPig,2020-04-22T17:46:57.353Z,i think this guy is being compleatly disrespectful of the fact that he is at his mothers house
18,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f76396d,newWolf,2020-04-22T17:46:59.732Z,I feel like she is the asshole because its her mothers house
18,3,5d482ea921c9be351f763783,newPig,2020-04-22T17:47:07.508Z,totaly agree
18,3,5ea0720c9dc0406f8987ce48,spryGiraffe,2020-04-22T17:47:07.696Z,"The first thing I noticed is that the author doesn't talk about his mother's feelings. He's only concerned about making his husband feel ""comfortable""."
18,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f76396d,newWolf,2020-04-22T17:47:15.835Z,exactly
18,3,5d482ea921c9be351f763783,newPig,2020-04-22T17:47:20.603Z,yes 
18,3,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T17:47:25.640Z,Yeah I agree. She should have a talk with her husband so that they can find a solution in which everyone is comfortable. 
18,3,5d482ea921c9be351f763783,newPig,2020-04-22T17:47:33.951Z,it seems we are all on the same page here
18,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f76396d,newWolf,2020-04-22T17:47:43.478Z,Its not polite to leave someone out of the conversation
18,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636ad,spryBear,2020-04-22T17:47:44.601Z,I think the son is an asshole.  He should comply with his mother's requests as long as they are reasonable since he is staying at her house.  This seems to be a reasonable request.
18,3,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T17:47:51.665Z,She is seeing her mother after a long time as well so it is rude if she will be at her house but not communicating properly.
18,3,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T17:48:03.805Z,So seems like our verdict is that this person is an asshole.
18,3,5d482ea921c9be351f763783,newPig,2020-04-22T17:48:18.765Z,yeah it would seem resonalable to limit the german only ttalking to when they were alone
18,3,5ea0720c9dc0406f8987ce48,spryGiraffe,2020-04-22T17:48:20.221Z,They can speak German when it's just them two in private. But they should at least make an effort to speak English when the mother is around.
18,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636ad,spryBear,2020-04-22T17:48:25.455Z,"I agree with likelyDonkey  he hasn't seen his mother in a long time, he should be worried about communicating with her not his husband"
18,3,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T17:48:57.461Z,Yes I am sure the mother feels very uncomfortable now.
18,3,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T17:49:00.342Z,Great.
18,3,5ea0720c9dc0406f8987ce48,spryGiraffe,2020-04-22T17:49:37.811Z,I don't see how it can be so uncomfortable for the husband to speak English with the family. It's not like he's giving a speech to a crowd.
18,3,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T17:49:56.837Z,I think he gets embarrassed when he says something wrong
18,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636ad,spryBear,2020-04-22T17:50:05.282Z,agreed.  i'm sure the mother would be undertanding that he doesn't speak English very well
18,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636ad,spryBear,2020-04-22T17:50:55.352Z,and it also sounds like the mother was nice when she requested it...not mean
18,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f76396d,newWolf,2020-04-22T17:51:13.703Z,Yep she sounds like she just wants to spend time with them
18,3,5d482ea921c9be351f763783,newPig,2020-04-22T17:52:15.986Z,yeah so why did he even go to his mothers if he only cares for his husband
18,3,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T17:52:26.341Z,That is so true.
18,3,5ea06c089dc0406f8987c3c6,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T17:52:38.763Z,I am concluding that this person is an asshole for the way the situation was handled.
18,3,5ea0720c9dc0406f8987ce48,spryGiraffe,2020-04-22T17:52:45.072Z,I am voting that he is an asshole.
18,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f76396d,newWolf,2020-04-22T17:52:46.700Z,I agree
19,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e0a,newOrangutan,2020-04-22T17:01:56.368Z,I'm sort of on the fence on this one.
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763ada,youngRabbit,2020-04-22T17:01:58.159Z,He should want to help his family.
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b8,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T17:02:00.455Z,Me too
19,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e0a,newOrangutan,2020-04-22T17:02:08.817Z,I can see both sides
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639f7,snappyPig,2020-04-22T17:02:09.172Z,One initial thought that came to mind is how difficult English is for non-native speakers. 
19,1,5ea06f469dc0406f8987c82e,niceHippo,2020-04-22T17:02:09.662Z,Agreed. I could see reasons for both sides.
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763ada,youngRabbit,2020-04-22T17:02:26.339Z,They don't want to be a burden. 
19,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f68,newBear,2020-04-22T17:02:29.857Z,It's not that hard to help her mother out herself.
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b8,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T17:02:38.435Z,I think the person should also consider that if it's no big deal for her husband to dedicate the time then she should also do it.
19,1,5ea06e7e9dc0406f8987c6ee,culturedGorilla,2020-04-22T17:02:47.531Z,     
19,1,5ea06f469dc0406f8987c82e,niceHippo,2020-04-22T17:02:47.823Z,The narrator seemed a bit selfish to assume the husband could handle the role each time.
19,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e0a,newOrangutan,2020-04-22T17:02:47.876Z,They make fun of the gringo and then rely on his translation skills
19,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f68,newBear,2020-04-22T17:02:57.706Z,"The husband shouldn't have to be responsible to translate just so ""he can practice""  "
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639f7,snappyPig,2020-04-22T17:03:04.100Z,"Well. She is also in school but that will last maybe 2 years, so the guy has to help for a couple of years only... "
19,1,5ea06f469dc0406f8987c82e,niceHippo,2020-04-22T17:03:05.848Z,True. But then the husband's point of view did seem a bit rude.
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b8,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T17:03:09.207Z,"However, the husband was also being inconsiderate when he said that they should just learn English."
19,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e0a,newOrangutan,2020-04-22T17:03:20.030Z,He took the intiative to learn Spanish so i can see his point
19,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f68,newBear,2020-04-22T17:03:21.510Z,The husband could be more willing to help.
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763ada,youngRabbit,2020-04-22T17:03:22.884Z,I think the husband is a jerk.
19,1,5ea06e7e9dc0406f8987c6ee,culturedGorilla,2020-04-22T17:03:37.940Z,         
19,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f68,newBear,2020-04-22T17:03:39.319Z,"It should't be expected for him to help, they're both busy"
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b8,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T17:03:39.373Z,"So far, I think the husband was rude."
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763ada,youngRabbit,2020-04-22T17:03:48.467Z,Why did he even learn spanish
19,1,5ea06f469dc0406f8987c82e,niceHippo,2020-04-22T17:03:51.119Z,"I think the husband is rude, but I guess it was also a bit rude for the narrator to assume he should be obligated to help"
19,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f68,newBear,2020-04-22T17:03:58.857Z,I think the wife puts unfair responsibilities on her husband
19,1,5ea06e7e9dc0406f8987c6ee,culturedGorilla,2020-04-22T17:04:06.634Z,    
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639f7,snappyPig,2020-04-22T17:04:17.209Z,Like I get that it can be a bit irritating to always have to help with this or that but he could still approach it otherwise. Like use his time with them to also teach them.
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b8,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T17:04:30.073Z,I agree 
19,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e0a,newOrangutan,2020-04-22T17:04:36.100Z,That's a good idea
19,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f68,newBear,2020-04-22T17:04:37.300Z,Yes but it shouldn't be an expectation
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763ada,youngRabbit,2020-04-22T17:04:38.771Z,All she is asking is that he help to translate every once in a while.
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b8,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T17:04:53.625Z,He kind of just left them to their own devices by saying that they should learn English.
19,1,5ea06f469dc0406f8987c82e,niceHippo,2020-04-22T17:05:06.306Z,I think the prompt was vague though in if she was asking him to do it or basically requiring him to help them
19,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f68,newBear,2020-04-22T17:05:26.961Z,it makes it sound as though its his job now
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639f7,snappyPig,2020-04-22T17:05:27.687Z,"Even if they were to learn English, they would learn it overnight. In the mean whiles he still has to help them."
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b8,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T17:05:29.332Z,I think he just assumed the role when the mom started calling him directly.
19,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e0a,newOrangutan,2020-04-22T17:05:34.768Z,I don't think he should just be expected to translate. it would be nice if he was at least given a choice
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b8,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T17:06:25.282Z,That's true. 
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639f7,snappyPig,2020-04-22T17:06:25.969Z,I think the wife also needs to consider that constantly helping them with English may also not be helping the parents either. What if he gets sick?
19,1,5ea06e7e9dc0406f8987c6ee,culturedGorilla,2020-04-22T17:06:59.186Z,                 
19,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f68,newBear,2020-04-22T17:07:35.993Z,I think they both could approach this differently. 
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b8,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T17:07:43.483Z,I think they should have talked about it more. 
19,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639f7,snappyPig,2020-04-22T17:07:53.720Z,"In the end, its tough but I will err on the side of the wife. I think that we are not asking the hubs to do this in the long haul. Just for a short whiles."
19,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b8,littleRabbit,2020-04-22T17:16:44.820Z,My initial impression is that he is being rude.
19,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f68,snappyGorilla,2020-04-22T17:16:47.821Z,The husband is way out of line
19,2,5ea06e7e9dc0406f8987c6ee,littleDonkey,2020-04-22T17:16:53.343Z, 
19,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763e0a,niceHorse,2020-04-22T17:16:59.863Z,This guy obviously has a gift for languages. It's his right to use that gift any way he chooses.
19,2,5ea06f469dc0406f8987c82e,spryHippo,2020-04-22T17:17:00.504Z,"Agreed. I can see why he must be frustrated, but that's not the way to respond"
19,2,5ea06e7e9dc0406f8987c6ee,littleDonkey,2020-04-22T17:17:05.495Z,     
19,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b8,littleRabbit,2020-04-22T17:17:13.678Z,He should have approached the situation differently. 
19,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639f7,snappyLion,2020-04-22T17:17:19.079Z,"I did not like his tone throughout most of it. I wondered that if his tone is like this that easily, then what was he really like with the mom?"
19,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763e0a,niceHorse,2020-04-22T17:17:29.133Z,"If anything, the family is being rcist"
19,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f68,snappyGorilla,2020-04-22T17:17:29.688Z,He did give her a lot of tools to use to help her learn English though
19,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b8,littleRabbit,2020-04-22T17:17:34.707Z,Just because it is easy for him doesn't mean it is easy for the family.
19,2,5ea06f469dc0406f8987c82e,spryHippo,2020-04-22T17:17:46.807Z,"He did, but that doesnt mean the parents can access those tools like he can"
19,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f68,snappyGorilla,2020-04-22T17:18:02.102Z,He could have confided in his wife to let her know that it's bothering him and see how he should approach it in a positive way
19,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639f7,snappyLion,2020-04-22T17:18:03.903Z,"English is a lot harder than many other languages. If you are born in it, it is hard to see that. Its not that easy to pick up."
19,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b8,littleRabbit,2020-04-22T17:18:08.035Z,He also made it to be like they are not trying when he doesn't know their situation.
19,2,5ea06e7e9dc0406f8987c6ee,littleDonkey,2020-04-22T17:18:15.835Z,      
19,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763ada,youngSquirrel,2020-04-22T17:18:19.495Z,The way she speaks to people is disrespectful. 
19,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b8,littleRabbit,2020-04-22T17:18:29.718Z,He is disrespectful. 
19,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763e0a,niceHorse,2020-04-22T17:18:40.508Z,i think they are relying on him too much.'
19,2,5ea06f469dc0406f8987c82e,spryHippo,2020-04-22T17:18:41.983Z,He is voicing frustration but it does not seem like he is trying to think about the family's perspective on why it might be hard for them
19,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f68,snappyGorilla,2020-04-22T17:18:43.539Z,"He really should have been respectful to her and helped her out, does it really take that much time out of his schedule?"
19,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639f7,snappyLion,2020-04-22T17:18:44.921Z,"I think he does have a point, but the way he seemed to be going about it ..."
19,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f68,snappyGorilla,2020-04-22T17:18:56.909Z,He is frustrated and should be able to talk to his family
19,2,5ea06f469dc0406f8987c82e,spryHippo,2020-04-22T17:19:13.188Z,I think he could have instead offered to help her instead of just giving her resources to basically help herself
19,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b8,littleRabbit,2020-04-22T17:19:16.722Z,He does have a point but he let his frustration get in the way. Even his family doesn't agree with him from my understanding. 
19,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763ada,youngSquirrel,2020-04-22T17:19:23.385Z,he is rude.
19,2,5ea06f469dc0406f8987c82e,spryHippo,2020-04-22T17:19:27.215Z,agreed
19,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f68,snappyGorilla,2020-04-22T17:19:38.624Z,"His family has a right to be upset, he was really rude"
19,2,5ea06e7e9dc0406f8987c6ee,littleDonkey,2020-04-22T17:19:40.257Z,
19,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639f7,snappyLion,2020-04-22T17:19:47.798Z,"You can be respectful and still gently suggest Mango, ESL or something like that. "
19,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763e0a,niceHorse,2020-04-22T17:19:49.155Z,I'm getting the impression that there are other issues here as well
19,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639b8,littleRabbit,2020-04-22T17:19:59.568Z,I agree. There is something else.
19,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f7639f7,snappyLion,2020-04-22T17:20:17.111Z,Like how often he has to keep answering them?
19,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763ada,youngSquirrel,2020-04-22T17:20:18.872Z,i agree
19,2,5ea06f469dc0406f8987c82e,spryHippo,2020-04-22T17:20:21.631Z,good point
19,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f68,snappyGorilla,2020-04-22T17:20:40.811Z,They probably have a opinion about him anyway from before this.  
19,2,5ea06f469dc0406f8987c82e,spryHippo,2020-04-22T17:20:43.694Z,maybe he feels the family is taking advantage of him
19,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763e0a,niceHorse,2020-04-22T17:20:54.813Z,Maybe he resents being the token gringo

20,2,5e9f44049dc0406f898789b2,culturedBison,2020-04-22T17:04:17.336Z,She's the asshole because she assigned this responsibility to him without consulting.

21,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T19:39:47.230Z,"This one is tough but I think that overall, the mother ITA."
21,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763ba2,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T19:40:06.279Z,I agree
21,0,5e9f4d469dc0406f8987a196,littleCow,2020-04-22T19:40:17.339Z,I disagree and think that the mother is not the asshole. I think this because it really isn't fair that her son and his partner were talking in front of her in a language she doesn't understand.
21,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T19:40:30.136Z,The French guy should definitely make more of an effort to use English but asking him not to use his mother tongue is unreasonable.
21,0,5ea076269dc0406f8987dbf8,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-22T19:40:34.393Z,"The parent is the asshole here, the kids husband learned English to participate in the converstaion, they can learn French if they want to participate "
21,0,5ea07d9c9dc0406f89880001,niceBison,2020-04-22T19:40:42.427Z,"I agree. I think the mother should respect that the sons partner only speaks French. If she was really about the situation, she would kindly ask to learn the language as well. "
21,0,5ea076269dc0406f8987dbf8,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-22T19:40:55.755Z,He may not feel comfortable talking in English
21,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T19:41:16.927Z,"Most couples have a ""secret language"" but this one just happens to be an actual other language. "
21,0,5e9f4d469dc0406f8987a196,littleCow,2020-04-22T19:41:25.523Z,I don't know. I think it's a bit rude to talk in a different language when you know someone in the room can't. Shouldn't they involve her in the conversation if she's there?
21,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T19:41:38.871Z,"That is a good point, likelyOrangutan"
21,0,5e9f4d469dc0406f8987a196,littleCow,2020-04-22T19:41:44.586Z,And keep their private conversations to themselves if they want to talk about something.
21,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763808,smallHorse,2020-04-22T19:41:55.964Z,"I think that the asshole  is equally divided between the two actually.  The mother should have said something discreetly to her son alone, not made a scene. But the son should have known better than to exclude his mother, and leave her out."
21,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763ba2,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T19:42:10.727Z,I think that the mother of those kids should let her kids go to disney world with her ex. I dont think she is being honest about her reasons for saying no .
21,0,5ea07d9c9dc0406f89880001,niceBison,2020-04-22T19:42:15.720Z,That is a good point though. Yeah they should keep their conversations private and let the mom in on their conversations in public...you're right
21,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T19:42:16.864Z,"That might have been the case, littleCow  It could have been a private thing."
21,0,5e9f4d469dc0406f8987a196,littleCow,2020-04-22T19:42:17.195Z,I can see that smallHorse
21,0,5ea076269dc0406f8987dbf8,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-22T19:42:28.862Z,So he sould ask everyone around him if they speak his language before talking? That sounds likea  great way to give him more axiety
21,0,5ea07d9c9dc0406f89880001,niceBison,2020-04-22T19:42:31.705Z,I can see that conventionalLion
21,0,5e9f4d469dc0406f8987a196,littleCow,2020-04-22T19:43:03.263Z,I'm not saying that at all likelyOrangutan I just think it's rude that they'd have a conversation in front of one other person when they know they can't understand.
21,0,5ea076269dc0406f8987dbf8,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-22T19:43:14.481Z,"If he is talking to you he'll speak in a language you can understand, if not then its none of your business what hes saying"
21,0,5e9f4d469dc0406f8987a196,littleCow,2020-04-22T19:43:16.586Z,If someone did that to me I'd feel like the people were talking badly about me and that's not a fair situation. 
21,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763808,smallHorse,2020-04-22T19:43:19.001Z,"If I had to pick one though, I guess I would say mom is the bigger asshole.  She should not have made a scene and embarrassed them both."
21,0,5ea076269dc0406f8987dbf8,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-22T19:43:20.023Z,If you want to know learn the language
21,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T19:43:28.991Z,"I pretty much agree, smallHorse  there is some blame on both sides but I would give more to the mother for making a scene about it."
21,0,5ea076269dc0406f8987dbf8,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-22T19:43:30.689Z,Don't be paranoid
21,0,5ea076269dc0406f8987dbf8,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-22T19:43:38.033Z,The world doesnt revolve around you
21,0,5ea07d9c9dc0406f89880001,niceBison,2020-04-22T19:43:45.774Z,I do consider both sides of the agrument because maybe the son and his partner were having a private conservation and then the partner felt uncomfortable. So that's why he went upstairs to save the rest of the conservation for later.
21,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7638a5,newSquirrel,2020-04-22T19:43:49.188Z,I think it is just easier for the husband to continue speaking French and may not know how to express what he wants to say in English.
21,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763ba2,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T19:43:59.262Z,I think the son and his friends should speak in a language that his mother understands when she is around. He should try to make her feel more comfortable when she is around.
21,0,5e9f4d469dc0406f8987a196,littleCow,2020-04-22T19:44:12.450Z,They should especially make her feel comfortable seeing as they were in her house.
21,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763808,smallHorse,2020-04-22T19:44:25.312Z,good point littleCow 
21,0,5ea076269dc0406f8987dbf8,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-22T19:44:30.234Z,"And if they are talking about you who give a fuck if they say it in another language in front of you, or in your language behind your back either way you're not going to know"
21,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T19:44:33.174Z,"A good point, newSquirrel,  we don't know his level of proficiency."
21,0,5ea07d9c9dc0406f89880001,niceBison,2020-04-22T19:44:38.260Z,The husband should continue speaking in the language he is comfortable with. With also respecting the mother in the process since it is her house. 
21,0,5ea07d9c9dc0406f89880001,niceBison,2020-04-22T19:44:45.109Z,Good point
21,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T19:45:27.794Z,I am still leaning towards the mother but there is blame for everyone here.
21,0,5ea076269dc0406f8987dbf8,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-22T19:45:36.454Z,"Demanding that someone speak your language when the converstaion doesn't involve you is pure narcissim, demanding you be included even when not needed"
21,0,5e9f4d469dc0406f8987a196,littleCow,2020-04-22T19:45:46.207Z,I honestly believe the mother wasn't trying to be offensive. I think she just wanted to be included. Maybe she wants to build a better relationship with the partner. I don't think she's the asshole.
21,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,culturedPig,2020-04-22T20:09:27.293Z,"As in the first one, I do not believe that this person is the asshole."
21,2,5e9f4d469dc0406f8987a196,likelyGorilla,2020-04-22T20:09:46.938Z,My initial impression here is that the son is the asshole because he knows his mother can't speak German and they're in her house.
21,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,culturedPig,2020-04-22T20:09:53.173Z,But I think it's a very close thing and steps should be taken by both sides.
21,2,5ea076269dc0406f8987dbf8,niceLion,2020-04-22T20:09:55.398Z,"NO he's not an asshole, but he should include his mother more and make an effort to help his husband speak better english"
21,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763808,conventionalPanda,2020-04-22T20:10:04.075Z,"The son is the asshole. He stated he made a choice to basically exclude his mother. He should have compromised.  Spoke English some, German some. Instead, he's an asshole. "
21,2,5e9f4d469dc0406f8987a196,likelyGorilla,2020-04-22T20:10:12.680Z,I think it's unfair that they sit and speak in German when the husband can speak English.
21,2,5ea07d9c9dc0406f89880001,spryCow,2020-04-22T20:10:22.321Z,"I do agree with the person not being an asshole. I think if the mother was really interested, she would learn some German or help the husband speak better english."
21,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,culturedPig,2020-04-22T20:10:23.044Z,We know that English can make the husband uncomfortable.
21,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763ba2,niceRhino,2020-04-22T20:10:56.139Z,I think the son of the mother should volunteer to help her learn how to speak english if she is willing to learn it.
21,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,culturedPig,2020-04-22T20:11:00.168Z,That's why this one is so tough.  Everyone is a bit of an asshole here.
21,2,5e9f4d469dc0406f8987a196,likelyGorilla,2020-04-22T20:11:01.421Z,I don't think it's fair to say that just because he's uncomfortable speaking English he shouldn't. Is it fair that the mother is now uncomfortable being excluded in conversations?
21,2,5ea07d9c9dc0406f89880001,spryCow,2020-04-22T20:11:22.115Z,"On the other hand, I think everyone is being a bit of an asshole in this situation"
21,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,culturedPig,2020-04-22T20:11:52.112Z,He shouldn't have to speak only English but should make more of an effort.  As should the MIL.
21,2,5e9f4d469dc0406f8987a196,likelyGorilla,2020-04-22T20:12:15.713Z,I agree that everyone is kind of an asshole here. I do think the son is more so because he basically sacrificed his mother's comfort for his spouse's. I think he should have found a compromise.
21,2,5ea07d9c9dc0406f89880001,spryCow,2020-04-22T20:12:16.762Z,I mean they can have their private conversations in German and then speak to the MIL in English when they can
21,2,5ea076269dc0406f8987dbf8,niceLion,2020-04-22T20:12:26.717Z,"Why does the mother need to be included? The son should be sharing more with her, but she doesn't need to be in every conversation."
21,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763808,conventionalPanda,2020-04-22T20:12:32.367Z,The son had a bad attitude. He is only there fora short time. He should have been more adaptable to his mother.
21,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,culturedPig,2020-04-22T20:12:35.765Z,"I agree, spryCow"
21,2,5e9f4d469dc0406f8987a196,likelyGorilla,2020-04-22T20:13:04.061Z,He's with his spouse all the time. He's not with his mother for a very long time. I think they can sacrifice speaking German for the short time they are there.
21,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763808,conventionalPanda,2020-04-22T20:13:27.678Z,"Yes, considering both sides, the son is still the asshole because he is too inflexible, and even with options, chose exclusion of his mother."
21,2,5ea07d9c9dc0406f89880001,spryCow,2020-04-22T20:13:37.161Z,I do consider both sides of this because everyone is being a bit of an asshole but the MIL should be included in a little bit of their conversations
21,2,5e9f4d469dc0406f8987a196,likelyGorilla,2020-04-22T20:13:42.364Z,That's what I think also conventionalPanda
21,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763ba2,niceRhino,2020-04-22T20:13:45.814Z,I do agree. The mother does not need to be in every conversation that her son has.
21,2,5ea076269dc0406f8987dbf8,niceLion,2020-04-22T20:14:03.969Z,"Like you said they are there for a short time, Why should they change thier primary means of communication just to include her?"
21,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,culturedPig,2020-04-22T20:14:09.750Z,That's why having this be a binary thing is not great.
21,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,culturedPig,2020-04-22T20:14:22.668Z,No room for nuance in the polls.
21,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763808,conventionalPanda,2020-04-22T20:14:29.938Z,true culturedPig
21,2,5ea07d9c9dc0406f89880001,spryCow,2020-04-22T20:14:31.084Z,I agree culturedPig
21,2,5e9f4d469dc0406f8987a196,likelyGorilla,2020-04-22T20:14:37.982Z,He stated he has spoken mainly in German since he's been there. I'm not saying she has to be in every conversation but to exclude her from most conversations isn't right.
21,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763808,conventionalPanda,2020-04-22T20:15:22.141Z,"Like in most things, there is blame to go around but the son is the bigger asshole because he is too inflexible and inconsiderate of ALL concerned. "
21,2,5ea076269dc0406f8987dbf8,niceLion,2020-04-22T20:15:33.420Z,"Do all the convos require her? He seems to be speaking in English when involing her, and German when its just the two of them talking to each other. Just because shes in the room doesn't mean she needs to be involved"
21,2,5e9f4d469dc0406f8987a196,likelyGorilla,2020-04-22T20:15:52.270Z,I agree with conventionalPanda I think the son needs to think about his mother also. Clearly he's spoken in German quite a lot if she's bothered by it enough to bring it up.
21,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a45,culturedPig,2020-04-22T20:15:58.395Z,I think the opposite.  The MIL should be a bit more flexible.
21,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763ba2,niceRhino,2020-04-22T20:16:01.563Z,I think the mother should take responsibility for her self and try to learn how to speak english.

22,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763df6,niceRabbit,2020-04-22T20:04:16.738Z,Hi there
22,1,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,spryMonkey,2020-04-22T20:04:18.733Z,Hello
22,1,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:04:21.891Z,I don't understand why she was so bothered by her son's talking in French
22,1,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:04:31.125Z,I think she was being unreasonable. What do you think?
22,1,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,spryMonkey,2020-04-22T20:04:43.140Z,I think her request was valid
22,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763cc6,newRhino,2020-04-22T20:04:45.380Z,I think that she was being unreasonable.  There was no need to be hurtful.
22,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637e0,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:04:46.236Z,"Hello, I work with people who speak a different language and I find it a bit disrespectful if they exclude me by not speaking so I can understand."
22,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763df6,niceRabbit,2020-04-22T20:04:47.995Z,She is 100% not the asshole here.
22,1,5ea098d69dc0406f89883084,smallBison,2020-04-22T20:04:49.725Z,I think that she was justified in asking if they would speak English in her presence.
22,1,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,spryMonkey,2020-04-22T20:04:54.148Z,She just wanted to be a part of the conversation
22,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637e0,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:05:10.348Z,"I agree, they can speak French when they are not with her and she is hosting them."
22,1,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:05:10.645Z,But her son's husband doesn't speak English well.
22,1,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:05:17.250Z,And her son was trying to accomodate him
22,1,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,spryMonkey,2020-04-22T20:05:23.036Z,If they wanted to speak in French only they could have done it not in front of her
22,1,5ea098d69dc0406f89883084,smallBison,2020-04-22T20:05:25.347Z,He does but he just has an accent
22,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763df6,niceRabbit,2020-04-22T20:05:31.485Z,It's is etiquette 101 that you don't exclude people by conversing in front of them in a language they don't understand.
22,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637e0,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:05:41.396Z,"You're right, but he can try when she is present."
22,1,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,spryMonkey,2020-04-22T20:05:41.857Z,agree nice niceRabbit
22,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da6,smallHippo,2020-04-22T20:05:46.627Z,"I think if they were all talking in English and it suddenly shifted to French, it would naturally feel a bit like you were being purposely left out."
22,1,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:05:55.775Z,I get it but I am sure the French guy did not mean to offend her
22,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da6,smallHippo,2020-04-22T20:05:56.464Z,I can understand her reaction a little bit.
22,1,5ea098d69dc0406f89883084,smallBison,2020-04-22T20:05:59.313Z,Yeah like being at the nail salon or something
22,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637e0,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:06:00.875Z,That is what it feel like to me at work.
22,1,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,spryMonkey,2020-04-22T20:06:08.767Z,"Plus, they are staying in her house, so they do owe her a level of respect for that"
22,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763df6,niceRabbit,2020-04-22T20:06:17.760Z,"He speaks English, he's in her home, she's expressed offense - they should have apologized to her."
22,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637e0,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:06:21.300Z,She could be nice about it and go mainly through her son.
22,1,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:06:21.763Z,Well sorry to hear that smallGiraffe
22,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637e0,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:06:27.188Z,Thank you
22,1,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:06:55.965Z,Would she have felt differently if they talked in English?
22,1,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:07:02.699Z,I am not sure
22,1,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,spryMonkey,2020-04-22T20:07:16.967Z,"Maybe, but at least she would have known what they were talking about"
22,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763df6,niceRabbit,2020-04-22T20:07:22.017Z,"She speaks English, so she wouldn't have felt excluded from their conversation."
22,1,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:07:23.286Z,They would have included her in the convo had it concerned her
22,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637e0,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:07:28.900Z,"I think have been nicer to talk to her son privately about this, but she is not wrong to want them to include her."
22,1,5ea098d69dc0406f89883084,smallBison,2020-04-22T20:07:29.424Z,She at least would know what they were saying. It's human nature to just assume someone is talking about you if you don't understand them
22,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da6,smallHippo,2020-04-22T20:07:30.813Z,I imagine they were all talking in English before that point okay.
22,1,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,spryMonkey,2020-04-22T20:07:30.909Z,It seemed odd that they abruptly ended the conversation too
22,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763df6,niceRabbit,2020-04-22T20:07:52.504Z,"It doesn't have to ""concern"" her. They're staying in her home. "
22,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da6,smallHippo,2020-04-22T20:07:58.079Z,"Yeah. It didn't seem necessary. If they moved to speaking French as they were doing something separately, I'd understand."
22,1,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,spryMonkey,2020-04-22T20:08:10.108Z,"true, she could have addressed it privately smallGiraffe"
22,1,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:08:25.903Z,niceRabbit I understand your point but I mildly disagree
22,1,5ea098d69dc0406f89883084,smallBison,2020-04-22T20:08:31.246Z,The request could have been handled better but it still doesn't make her an asshole.
22,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637e0,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:08:42.466Z,"Well, her method could have been better, but is sounds like we mainly agree?"
22,1,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,spryMonkey,2020-04-22T20:08:42.930Z,good point smallBison
22,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763df6,niceRabbit,2020-04-22T20:08:45.674Z,It's almost like if you go up to someone in mixed company and whisper in their ear. It's rude. People are going to wonder why you're doing that and what you're talking about that.
22,1,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,spryMonkey,2020-04-22T20:09:01.061Z,agree
22,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763df6,niceRabbit,2020-04-22T20:09:04.503Z,"I don't think her son is the asshole, either, actually. I think the partner is. Big baby."
22,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da6,smallHippo,2020-04-22T20:09:05.955Z,"Yeah. That seems natural to me too, niceRabbit"
22,1,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:09:06.363Z,I still think she was insensitive
22,1,5ea098d69dc0406f89883084,smallBison,2020-04-22T20:09:06.772Z,I think we have a consensus 
22,1,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,spryMonkey,2020-04-22T20:09:31.576Z,why do you think so conventionalOrangutan
22,1,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:09:38.939Z,Do we have to give a unanimous decision?
22,1,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,spryMonkey,2020-04-22T20:09:52.627Z,not an asshole?
22,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763df6,niceRabbit,2020-04-22T20:09:57.526Z,"No, mom is not the asshole."
22,1,5ea098d69dc0406f89883084,smallBison,2020-04-22T20:09:57.972Z,Not
22,1,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,spryMonkey,2020-04-22T20:10:02.787Z,Not

22,1,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:10:28.406Z,sure
22,1,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:10:29.557Z,Not
22,1,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,spryMonkey,2020-04-22T20:10:41.353Z,make sure to vote
22,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da6,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-22T20:19:06.764Z,Hi again

22,2,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T20:19:09.361Z,Hello there!
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:19:11.968Z,hello
22,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7637e0,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T20:19:14.729Z,Hello
22,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763df6,nicePanda,2020-04-22T20:19:15.832Z,Yo
22,2,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T20:19:16.345Z,A very similar scenario
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:19:23.013Z,where does everyone stand so far?
22,2,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T20:19:34.233Z,"I want to say ""Not"" but I have a mixed feeling"
22,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da6,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-22T20:19:43.994Z,Yeah. I don't know why the son has to choose one or the other. It seems like he could be understanding of both positions easily.
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:19:48.189Z,i say he is but only because he's in his mom's house again
22,2,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T20:19:48.681Z,The guy made a very tough decision
22,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763cc6,niceLion,2020-04-22T20:20:00.729Z,"I feel bad for his mom.  She was missing him, and she has a right to be a bit frustrated that her son isn't communicating"
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:20:04.010Z,but in marriage your loyalty is supposed to be to your partner
22,2,5ea098d69dc0406f89883084,youngGoat,2020-04-22T20:20:09.026Z,I say he is an asshole because he didn't really make much effort to speak English
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:20:18.518Z,so he did a good thing by choosing the partner
22,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da6,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-22T20:20:23.676Z,"That's fair, but everyone could put some effort here. "
22,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7637e0,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T20:20:32.988Z,"Yes, I think as a mother that I would want to spend every second with my daughter if I hardly got to see her"
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:20:34.001Z,"yeah, but it is her house"
22,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763cc6,niceLion,2020-04-22T20:20:37.436Z,I don't really think he did the right thing
22,2,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T20:20:40.541Z,I sorta think he disrespected his mom but it was a hard choice for him
22,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763df6,nicePanda,2020-04-22T20:20:47.103Z,So when they're in Germany does the husband only speak English so his spouse is comfortable?
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:20:48.878Z,i agree  lik
22,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763cc6,niceLion,2020-04-22T20:20:49.089Z,I think he disrespected his mother
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:20:55.639Z,agree
22,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da6,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-22T20:20:55.801Z,Agreed.
22,2,5ea098d69dc0406f89883084,youngGoat,2020-04-22T20:20:59.438Z,Yeah
22,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7637e0,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T20:21:01.538Z,"I know it would be a hard choice, but the mother needs time with her child"
22,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763df6,nicePanda,2020-04-22T20:21:22.990Z,Demanding the choice between spouse and parent over something so stupid is controlling
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:21:23.883Z,"if it was in his own home, then it would be a different outcome"
22,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da6,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-22T20:21:26.087Z,It's tough though. I don't think the partner or the mother are wrong. The son could be nicer about it.
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:21:31.116Z,but it's in her house
22,2,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T20:21:45.968Z,Would ve been much better had he spoke both English and German haha
22,2,5ea098d69dc0406f89883084,youngGoat,2020-04-22T20:21:49.169Z,I know I would probably rather keep my wife happy over my mom though
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:21:55.785Z,haha you
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:22:04.649Z,youngGoat
22,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7637e0,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T20:22:06.732Z,"Yes, the child should try very hard to include the mother for that weekend.  I'm a mom lol"
22,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763df6,nicePanda,2020-04-22T20:22:16.492Z,This isn't about keeping someone happy. It's about exerting power and control
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:22:31.088Z,plus it gives the partner a chance to practice English more
22,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7637e0,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T20:22:39.518Z,that is true
22,2,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T20:22:40.130Z,I'd say he was not an asshole but I still feel unsure
22,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7637e0,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T20:22:59.067Z,I'm thinking he or she probably is
22,2,5ea098d69dc0406f89883084,youngGoat,2020-04-22T20:23:07.626Z,I think ultimately he was an asshole
22,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da6,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-22T20:23:11.255Z,Yeah. I think the partner would become more comfortable with English if the son in this situation maybe forced it a bit to accommodate his mother
22,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763cc6,niceLion,2020-04-22T20:23:18.382Z,I'd say he was an asshole by the way he handled it.
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:23:19.118Z,i agree with youngGoat
22,2,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T20:23:34.702Z,Well then
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:23:39.130Z,You don't disrespect your host if you go there for dinner
22,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7637e0,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T20:23:44.163Z,They won't be with the mother the whole time and could try to include her when they are
22,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da6,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-22T20:23:55.361Z,Agreed culturedMonkey
22,2,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T20:23:55.630Z,I will join you guys
22,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763df6,nicePanda,2020-04-22T20:23:57.357Z,"Yep, asshole. But there's a lot more going on here than shyness about speaking a foreign language."
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:23:59.748Z,"same in this scenario, you don't not include the mom (in her own home)"
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:24:21.278Z,agree
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:24:30.964Z,are we at a consensus then?

22,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da6,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-22T20:24:42.449Z,yep
22,2,5ea098d69dc0406f89883084,youngGoat,2020-04-22T20:24:44.271Z,Yes I think so. He's an ahole

22,2,5ea099d09dc0406f898830a9,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T20:25:08.924Z,I guess you sometimes have to be an asshole. Tough choice though
22,2,5ea0998a9dc0406f8988308f,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-22T20:25:17.200Z,lol nicePanda
23,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762e70,niceDonkey,2020-04-22T20:07:53.737Z,She was in a tough position of making her husband comfortable while also including her mother. She had to balance the two.
23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763382,conventionalBear,2020-04-22T20:08:45.679Z,"I think the woman is being disrespectful toward her mother. The mother is kind enough to let them visit, yet she feels left out. The husband should not feel shy speaking English around his family, and this would be a good place to practice"

23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763117,snappyCow,2020-04-22T20:09:35.863Z,"I think the issue is that the son needed to speak with his mother aside from his husband. It may be hard for them all to participate in a conversation, but at least they could translate and work something out "
23,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763576,snappyGoat,2020-04-22T20:09:53.702Z,"The mother, as the host, should care about her son enough to be okay with him wanting to make his husband comfortable."
23,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762e70,niceDonkey,2020-04-22T20:10:04.596Z,"I do think that since her mother hosted them as guests, she should have included her in the conversation frequently."
23,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763ea6,snappyHippo,2020-04-22T20:10:08.017Z,"It's not that the husband did not speak English, he was just uncomfortable with it, but practicing it is what would make him more comfortable with it and this is the perfect opportunity for that."
23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76315c,spryWolf,2020-04-22T20:10:13.731Z,"Oh yeah right, this was a HE not a SHE sorry"
23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76325f,smallRabbit,2020-04-22T20:10:38.136Z,"No worries, I had to read that twice too."
23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7633d5,sprySquirrel,2020-04-22T20:10:39.230Z,"Get the Mother to learn German, learning a new language at an older age is a good way to stave off Alzheimers."
23,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762e70,niceDonkey,2020-04-22T20:10:40.495Z,"As long as she would have let her mother know the situation, I think all parties could understand."
23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763382,conventionalBear,2020-04-22T20:10:49.001Z,"I think the son (not the woman, oops) should be trying harder to include his mother. His mother simply wants to catch up. I doubt she would be judgmental toward the husband."
23,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763576,snappyGoat,2020-04-22T20:11:12.685Z,"But, yes, I do think it would be nice for the son and his husband to at least attempt to speak English around his mother."
23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76315c,spryWolf,2020-04-22T20:11:30.561Z,I feel a discussion should have been between the son and his mother before the visit so this could have been worked out before they arrived
23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76325f,smallRabbit,2020-04-22T20:11:31.898Z,I feel the same way and not being included in a conversation is quite annoying.
23,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763ea6,snappyHippo,2020-04-22T20:11:36.039Z,"It is probably more uncomfortable for the mother to sit there and not understand anything, then for the husband to go slightly out of his comfort zone to respect his partners family."
23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7633d5,sprySquirrel,2020-04-22T20:11:37.836Z,I considered both sides and there are limits to how accommodating one can be.
23,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762e70,niceDonkey,2020-04-22T20:11:41.391Z,I would feel bad if I hosted my child and their spouse and they spoke in another language most of the visit. I would feel disconnected and neglected.
23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763117,snappyCow,2020-04-22T20:11:45.349Z,"I think the mother definitely wanted to catch up with her son, but there's also a problem where the husband would feel left out as well."
23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763382,conventionalBear,2020-04-22T20:11:45.462Z,"It is his choice what language he speaks, however, if he did not plan to speak in a language his mother understood, why visit?"
23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7633d5,sprySquirrel,2020-04-22T20:12:11.040Z,"He's not just visiting, he lives there."
23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76315c,spryWolf,2020-04-22T20:12:12.993Z,I feel bad for the mom not able to understand German or be included in their conversations during the weekend visit
23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76325f,smallRabbit,2020-04-22T20:12:14.655Z,The mother doesn't even know if they are saying bad things about her.
23,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763ea6,snappyHippo,2020-04-22T20:12:52.124Z,He is visiting. It says it was just for the weekend.
23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763117,snappyCow,2020-04-22T20:13:28.642Z,I think there's a great opportunity for the mother to learn some German and his husband to learn more English so he feels comfortable
23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7633d5,sprySquirrel,2020-04-22T20:13:45.242Z,I do not think this person is the asshole but I know everyone else does.
23,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763117,snappyCow,2020-04-22T20:14:12.361Z,"I dont think either one of them are assholes, it just a comfort issue."
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763382,newGorilla,2020-04-22T20:52:31.933Z,"I don’t think it is too much to ask that the son and partner speak in a language that all can understand. The son and his partner are the guests and if they are visiting for a week, it is possible that the parent wants to catch up."
23,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763ea6,likelyRhino,2020-04-22T20:52:34.960Z,They should speak English since she is hosting them.
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763382,newGorilla,2020-04-22T20:52:44.126Z,"The son and partner can talk to each other in any language they want, but if it is a group conversation then they should use a common language that everyone understands. "
23,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e70,niceBison,2020-04-22T20:52:52.141Z,"His husband understands English, so he is not unable to speak in English. I can see it being seen as rude to speak in a language that the mother does not understand."
23,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763ea6,likelyRhino,2020-04-22T20:53:05.516Z,"Yes, they should speak English if the mother is around and part of the conversation."
23,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e70,niceBison,2020-04-22T20:53:14.499Z,"Since he speaks both, it is almost as if he is trying to avoid her hearing what they are saying."
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763117,niceWolf,2020-04-22T20:53:14.959Z,"I think its fair that the mother requested they speak in english, but I dont think right for her to be rude and disrespectful, perhaps they didn't know they were doing it"
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76325f,culturedCow,2020-04-22T20:53:28.348Z,I think the mother was correct in thinking that was disrespectful. They could have included her.
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763382,newGorilla,2020-04-22T20:53:35.550Z,"However, maybe the parent didn’t ask as respectfully as he/she said and that is actually what offended them. Even so, leaving the room is also disrespectful."
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76315c,culturedGoat,2020-04-22T20:53:47.680Z,I think a discussion should been made between the mom and her son before the visit.  I feel it was rude and disrespectful to disregard the mom in their conversations
23,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e70,niceBison,2020-04-22T20:53:57.574Z,"He may be more comfortable speaking in French, but I think he should be understanding of the mother's feelings while they are there."
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76325f,culturedCow,2020-04-22T20:54:03.216Z,They were in her home. She has a right to speak her mind.
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763382,newGorilla,2020-04-22T20:54:17.485Z,The parent and the son could still discuss things. The son is the guest.
23,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763ea6,likelyRhino,2020-04-22T20:54:17.765Z,She definitely has a right to ask them to speak in a language she understands
23,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763ea6,likelyRhino,2020-04-22T20:54:24.053Z,She is hosting them
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763382,newGorilla,2020-04-22T20:54:29.214Z,exactly
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7633d5,smallPanda,2020-04-22T20:54:48.534Z,"The husband sounds extremely rude, if I were her I'd put ex lax in all her SIL's food. "
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763117,niceWolf,2020-04-22T20:54:52.607Z,"They were in her home, but that doesn't mean she needed to be rude about it. Just asking them politely to speak in english would have been a better alternative"
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76325f,culturedCow,2020-04-22T20:55:02.647Z,A host should be respected for being nice enough to welcome them into her home. Not be left out.
23,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763ea6,likelyRhino,2020-04-22T20:55:18.661Z,She said she asked nicely
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7633d5,smallPanda,2020-04-22T20:55:36.188Z,He didn't have to skulk upstairs like a petulant child.
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76325f,culturedCow,2020-04-22T20:55:45.028Z,I don't she's the jerk here.
23,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763ea6,likelyRhino,2020-04-22T20:55:51.647Z,She is not
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763382,newGorilla,2020-04-22T20:56:10.462Z,"But maybe she didn't ask as nicely as she claims to have asked. Even so, they should be more respectful and speak in English. "
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76325f,culturedCow,2020-04-22T20:56:19.339Z,Think about going to another country and doing the same.
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763382,newGorilla,2020-04-22T20:56:21.582Z,She is right to ask that in her home.
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763117,niceWolf,2020-04-22T20:56:30.242Z,"I agree she asked nicely, but she also said ""I find it disrespectful that they’re speaking language I don’t understand and excluding me from conversation."" I feel like it was blown out of proportion"""
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76315c,culturedGoat,2020-04-22T20:56:47.242Z,"No one had to be rude at all, just needed better communication between everyone French or English doesnt matter"
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763117,niceWolf,2020-04-22T20:56:57.170Z,I agree
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7633d5,smallPanda,2020-04-22T20:57:15.545Z,"French people are rude, it is there default setting."
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76325f,culturedCow,2020-04-22T20:57:20.952Z,I think it is annoying to not include everyone in a conversation. Especially your guests.
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7633d5,smallPanda,2020-04-22T20:57:23.380Z,their*
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763382,newGorilla,2020-04-22T20:57:39.757Z,I'm French. I'm nice. :)
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76315c,culturedGoat,2020-04-22T20:57:54.385Z,Although it is somewhat rude when you are speaking in a language that you know the other person does not understand at all
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7633d5,smallPanda,2020-04-22T20:57:58.021Z,you're the exception...possibly.
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76325f,culturedCow,2020-04-22T20:58:14.795Z,I don't think the mom was an a-hole at all in this scenario.
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763382,newGorilla,2020-04-22T20:58:18.749Z,"I don't think she was at fault here, and is not the a-hole."
23,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763ea6,likelyRhino,2020-04-22T20:58:21.588Z,I dont think the mother was wrong
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76315c,culturedGoat,2020-04-22T20:58:40.714Z,No she was not to me either
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76325f,culturedCow,2020-04-22T20:58:47.142Z,So we all agree?
23,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763117,niceWolf,2020-04-22T20:58:56.198Z,"I don't think anyone is at fault, but it made everyone feel awkward. She could have handled the situation a little better with a joke."
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f36,littleGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:11:04.326Z,My  initial impression is that they are not the asshole
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,likelySquirrel,2020-04-22T20:11:12.625Z,I agree
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763495,niceGoat,2020-04-22T20:11:25.044Z,I agree with that as well.
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,spryBear,2020-04-22T20:11:34.823Z,I disagree
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7631c5,likelyPig,2020-04-22T20:11:38.026Z,I also agree.
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76354e,smallDonkey,2020-04-22T20:11:39.966Z,"This person is definitely the ""A"" in AITA. This is a false binary, they can easily speak German when alone with their spouse, and do some quick translation during family times."
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,spryBear,2020-04-22T20:12:11.163Z,I feel that she can help him through the language barrier
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,spryBear,2020-04-22T20:12:26.264Z,Its only right because they are staying at her mother's house 
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f36,littleGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:12:34.378Z,I think they are just trying to make their spouse comfortable
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,likelySquirrel,2020-04-22T20:12:37.755Z,"I think it's a high pressure situation for the husband, if the mom is offended over this, she may be offended easily and he's worried to make a mistake"
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763495,niceGoat,2020-04-22T20:12:46.229Z,I don't think either one is an asshole. I think that maybe the husband feels embarrassed and just needs to come forward and explain why he doesn't like to speak English in family settings.
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76354e,smallDonkey,2020-04-22T20:12:57.596Z,I'm with spryBear The spouse is not even trying to accomodate the mother.
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,likelySquirrel,2020-04-22T20:12:58.335Z,A lot obviously depends on how good his english is
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f60,smallHorse,2020-04-22T20:13:21.771Z,"I agree with niceGoat, it's mostly just a bad situation for the husband and mom"
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,spryBear,2020-04-22T20:13:23.089Z,This should be a time where he can practice
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f36,littleGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:13:26.998Z,Yes I agree it depends on his English and that neither person is really an asshole.
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76354e,smallDonkey,2020-04-22T20:13:35.311Z,"I'm sure the mother does not expect a dissertation, just some basics about the husband and their new life"
24,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c24,littleCow,2020-04-22T20:13:36.235Z,She can come to some type of agreement. It's not like he can't speak English. Why be shy around your mother in law. They live with her
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763495,niceGoat,2020-04-22T20:13:44.041Z,I think this whole situation could be easily resolved if they would talk with each other without judgements.
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,spryBear,2020-04-22T20:13:49.363Z,I do not feel that they are completly assholes but he should try
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,likelySquirrel,2020-04-22T20:13:58.820Z,Agreed niceGoat
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76354e,smallDonkey,2020-04-22T20:14:08.787Z,"At this point, I feel like all effort is being exerted by the mother."
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f36,littleGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:14:08.835Z,I agree niceGoat
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76354e,smallDonkey,2020-04-22T20:14:25.776Z,"The couple needs to step up, also, as relationships with family are give and take."
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763495,niceGoat,2020-04-22T20:14:32.815Z,"I can see how it the mother could find it disrespectful to speak in German in her home too, knowing that she cannot speak it."
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,spryBear,2020-04-22T20:14:45.071Z,I agree niceGoat
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,likelySquirrel,2020-04-22T20:14:47.659Z,Yeah it also depends how often they're doing it
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,likelySquirrel,2020-04-22T20:14:57.552Z,and if the daughter is translating for the mom
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f60,smallHorse,2020-04-22T20:15:06.439Z,"I agree the poster could try and include his mother, I'm sure shes just worried she might be doing something wrong and want to be a part of their lives"
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,likelySquirrel,2020-04-22T20:15:12.526Z,I can see it being offensive if she has no idea what they're talking about and no translation
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7631c5,likelyPig,2020-04-22T20:15:17.390Z,"I agree neither is an asshole. They both have valid reasons. But, in my personal opinion, I think the husband should at least try his English. Hopefully the mom would be more  understanding."
24,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c24,littleCow,2020-04-22T20:15:33.928Z,I don't think she even wants to try. She wants to appease her husband.
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f36,littleGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:15:39.645Z,I can see it being offensive as well if they are constantly doing it in front of her. It just depends how often it is happening.
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,spryBear,2020-04-22T20:15:40.185Z,To me it is very offensive to speak another language around others 
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f60,smallHorse,2020-04-22T20:15:48.327Z,"The husband does know English, he just has very little confidence in his ability to speak it"
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,likelySquirrel,2020-04-22T20:16:00.421Z,Yeah I'm starting to lean toward the daughter being the asshole
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763495,niceGoat,2020-04-22T20:16:05.119Z,Me too
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,likelySquirrel,2020-04-22T20:16:25.057Z,Seems like there has to be some effort from the couple
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,spryBear,2020-04-22T20:16:30.431Z,I do beleive that this person is an asshole because she shouldbe respectful to her mother 
24,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f36,littleGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:16:33.957Z,I agree they are slightly the asshole
24,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c24,littleCow,2020-04-22T20:16:58.576Z,I lean more towards she is the asshole 
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,spryBear,2020-04-22T20:17:02.233Z,Asshole
24,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763495,niceGoat,2020-04-22T20:17:09.936Z,I agree
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f60,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T20:55:29.873Z,"The son said it dead on, they are making a big deal over nothing. Sure its not great to be excluded, but you can ask to be included in nicer ways than this."
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763495,snappyPig,2020-04-22T20:55:29.959Z,I don't think the mother is the asshole in this situation.
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,smallBison,2020-04-22T20:55:34.832Z,I don't think she's the asshole either
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,youngGoat,2020-04-22T20:55:39.112Z,I do not feel that the mother is an asshole 
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f36,spryRhino,2020-04-22T20:55:45.107Z,I don't think she is the asshole either
24,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c24,littleBear,2020-04-22T20:55:52.181Z,I think she is the asshole
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763495,snappyPig,2020-04-22T20:55:56.906Z,I think she was nice when approaching them about the issue.
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,smallBison,2020-04-22T20:55:58.966Z,"She may have overreacted a bit, but I can see why it was frustrating"
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,youngGoat,2020-04-22T20:56:15.854Z,I feel that it is only right for them to speak English since they are in her house.
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f60,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T20:56:16.459Z,"I recognize her frustration, but she is making a big deal over nothing"
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631c5,likelyWolf,2020-04-22T20:56:19.132Z,"I don't feel like the mother is the asshole. The son's partner knows how to speak English, he just chose not to."
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,smallBison,2020-04-22T20:56:22.128Z,Especially when he can speak English pretty well it seems
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,smallBison,2020-04-22T20:56:28.725Z,agreed likelyWolf
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f36,spryRhino,2020-04-22T20:56:40.655Z,She felt excluded and they all know English
24,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c24,littleBear,2020-04-22T20:56:41.269Z,They weren't talking to her. It would be different if she was a part of the converstation.
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763495,snappyPig,2020-04-22T20:56:42.043Z,How else are you supposed to approach the situation though? There's no easy way to say it. She felt they were being disrespectful and expressed her opinions.
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,youngGoat,2020-04-22T20:56:42.875Z,He does speak English so why not speak it 
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f60,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T20:57:05.466Z,"I feel there is more to his decision not to speak english than ""I dont want to"""
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763495,snappyPig,2020-04-22T20:57:15.297Z,"I think it's rude to be sitting in the living room and speaking a language no one can understand, especially if the mother is in the room."
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,smallBison,2020-04-22T20:57:17.396Z,Yeah when the Mom is around I'm sure she wants to be involved in the conversation
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f36,spryRhino,2020-04-22T20:57:18.923Z,I agree snappyPig
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,smallBison,2020-04-22T20:57:22.346Z,Especially in the living room
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631c5,likelyWolf,2020-04-22T20:57:25.291Z,"I agree, youngGoat"
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763495,snappyPig,2020-04-22T20:57:28.824Z,"It's one thing if they were alone, but they obviously weren't."
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,youngGoat,2020-04-22T20:57:47.745Z,"It does not matter if they were not talking to her, but they are in her house and she was sitting there "
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f60,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T20:58:00.683Z,"If its a conversation between them, it makes no difference if the mom understands or not since it doesnt concern her"
24,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c24,littleBear,2020-04-22T20:58:04.293Z,I agree with the son she made a big deal about it. 
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,smallBison,2020-04-22T20:58:09.860Z,"Also, it mentioned they were staying in her house for a week so I'm guessing she doesn't get to see her son often"
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f36,spryRhino,2020-04-22T20:58:13.405Z,Its fine for them to speak French when they are alone but she says they were all together in the living room
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,smallBison,2020-04-22T20:58:37.083Z,And I'm sure she just wanted to be included as it was a conversation in the living room
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f60,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T20:58:38.163Z,Speaking to each other. Might be something a bit private that they dont want mom to hear
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,youngGoat,2020-04-22T20:58:39.016Z,I agree spryRhino
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631c5,likelyWolf,2020-04-22T20:58:41.839Z,agree spryRhino
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763495,snappyPig,2020-04-22T20:58:52.433Z,"Yea, I would feel excluded if it was my child in my home doing this. I don't think she's wrong for asking them to speak English around her"
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f60,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T20:59:14.795Z,"Shes not wrong to ask to be included, but I feel she went about the wrong way of doing it"
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,youngGoat,2020-04-22T20:59:16.704Z,I do not think she is wrong either snappyPig
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,smallBison,2020-04-22T20:59:41.335Z,Yeah she probably could have said it nicer or talked to her son in private
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631c5,likelyWolf,2020-04-22T20:59:47.420Z,I personally think the partner took it too far. What if he was the one that didn't understand the language? Wouldn't he feel left out?
24,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c24,littleBear,2020-04-22T20:59:47.510Z,I feel that's rude and entitled. Now things will be awkward. She could have pulled him to the side
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f60,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T21:00:12.522Z,"It might be he doesnt really understand the language, or has anxiety about speaking it"
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f36,spryRhino,2020-04-22T21:00:15.999Z,Yes maybe she could have approached it differently 
24,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c24,littleBear,2020-04-22T21:00:17.122Z,likelyWolf I agree
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763495,snappyPig,2020-04-22T21:00:31.521Z,"She could've pulled her son aside yes, but I felt like it was respectful of her to approach them together"
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,youngGoat,2020-04-22T21:00:44.666Z,I do not feel that it was rude. She addressed both of them at the same time. This way it does not make the partner feel that she is going bhind his back in a way.
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f36,spryRhino,2020-04-22T21:01:06.345Z,True it was good to address them together so it's not behind the partner's back
24,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c24,littleBear,2020-04-22T21:01:20.473Z,Well the partner was embarrassed so he left. It was her tone. 
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763495,snappyPig,2020-04-22T21:01:39.503Z,He was kind of rude to leave the room
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f60,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T21:01:39.813Z,She addressed them by saying she found them disrespectful over nothing
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,smallBison,2020-04-22T21:01:48.606Z,Impossible to know what her tone was unfortunately
24,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c24,littleBear,2020-04-22T21:01:49.208Z,I conclude she was the asshole 
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,youngGoat,2020-04-22T21:01:55.557Z,"Overall, I do not feel that she is an asshole. She addressed the issue at hand in front of both. And honestly, I do not feel that she meant any harm."
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763495,snappyPig,2020-04-22T21:01:57.319Z,I don't think she was the asshole
24,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76349b,youngGoat,2020-04-22T21:02:02.221Z,Not an asshole
24,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763052,smallBison,2020-04-22T21:02:10.385Z,"Agreed, not an asshole"
25,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762efd,youngCow,2020-04-22T20:12:46.659Z,"Despite his edit, I think he was probably disrespectful in telling her this based on the tone of his post."
25,0,5d482ea921c9be351f76365b,youngHippo,2020-04-22T20:13:08.987Z,I really think he's in the wrong here. He's clearly not being considerate and doesn't care. I don't think he's thinking from the MIL's perspective at all. And I agree with his other family members that he's being privileged. 
25,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f0a,smallPig,2020-04-22T20:13:24.288Z,I absolutely think he's wrong
25,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763728,niceGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:13:50.641Z,I think she is wrong.   In 8 years she should know how to speak the language.
25,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762efd,youngCow,2020-04-22T20:14:02.705Z,"OTOH, she should try to learn English."
25,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763e1b,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-22T20:14:08.562Z,My impression is that the MIL is in the wrong
25,0,5d482ea921c9be351f76365b,youngHippo,2020-04-22T20:14:09.821Z,The edit was just him backtracking. Who knows if he was actually polite in the way he said things to his mother in law. 
25,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f0a,smallPig,2020-04-22T20:14:49.404Z,Especially if he was frustrated...I don't think there was any politeness at all
25,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763e1b,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-22T20:14:50.300Z,The husband provided her online learning resources and directed the MIL to ESL classes but she refused to be helped
25,0,5d482ea921c9be351f76365b,youngHippo,2020-04-22T20:15:05.772Z,"It's not ok for someone to be rude in any situation. And in this situation, he's completely inconsiderate. We don't know if she refused help. "
25,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762efd,youngCow,2020-04-22T20:15:23.762Z,Older people have a tougher time learning languages.
25,0,5d482ea921c9be351f76365b,youngHippo,2020-04-22T20:15:39.708Z,"She might be learning but still needs help. He's not providing the whole picture. And I agree, it's a lot harder for older people to learn new languages."
25,0,5d482ea921c9be351f76365b,youngHippo,2020-04-22T20:16:01.130Z,"Especially when they're not exposed to the new language, which seems like the MIL is not."
25,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f0a,smallPig,2020-04-22T20:16:10.134Z,"I noticed how he indicated that he told her in the beginning paragraph that he was 'sick of her s**t"", but then later tried to edit it to say that he didn't really say that.  I feel like he's definitely not being honest"
25,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763728,niceGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:16:13.833Z,She could have at least made an attempt at trying to learn either with classes or by him training her.
25,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763e1b,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-22T20:16:24.493Z,I agree that is harder for older people to learn new languages and that we don't have the full picture of how much effort the MIL is putting in
25,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762efd,youngCow,2020-04-22T20:16:45.159Z,Any consensus?
25,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f0a,smallPig,2020-04-22T20:16:52.521Z,I believe that he was being close minded
25,0,5d482ea921c9be351f76365b,youngHippo,2020-04-22T20:16:59.278Z,I'm still thinking that he's in the wrong. 
25,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f0a,smallPig,2020-04-22T20:17:03.727Z,I agree
25,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762efd,youngCow,2020-04-22T20:17:15.771Z,I think he's the asshole.
25,0,5d482ea921c9be351f76365b,youngHippo,2020-04-22T20:18:09.657Z,Anyone else have any closing arguments?
25,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76365b,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:56:56.849Z,I don't think she's in the wrong. But I think her attitude could be a little better and she could thank her husband for helping her mother.
25,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762efd,snappyMonkey,2020-04-22T20:57:11.527Z,"Her husband married her, not her mom. She said her parents have worked hard to make it in this country, well learning English would help."
25,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f0a,niceCow,2020-04-22T20:57:17.013Z,"I don't think she is in the wrong either, I think he was being selfish"
25,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76365b,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:57:50.274Z,"The mom is probably not asking for help all the time, just occasionally. So the husband is being inconsiderate and should try to help out when he can"
25,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763e1b,snappyLion,2020-04-22T20:57:54.725Z,I can see both sides but I err on the side of the husband not being wrong
25,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f0a,niceCow,2020-04-22T20:58:06.784Z,"I feel like when you marry someone, you do have some responsibilities to the family as well, and why wouldn't you want to help out your family?"
25,3,5d482ea921c9be351f763728,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T20:58:13.555Z,I think parents should have taken online class or husband tutor parents to learn English.  
25,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763e1b,snappyLion,2020-04-22T20:58:31.824Z,It would be helpful to know how often her mom calls the husband
25,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76365b,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:58:38.381Z,Agree
25,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f0a,niceCow,2020-04-22T20:59:18.694Z,I don't think it's a reasonable expectation for the parents to get online to learn
25,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763e1b,snappyLion,2020-04-22T20:59:26.523Z,"Based on the info provided, its probably very often if he is getting frustrated"
25,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f0a,niceCow,2020-04-22T20:59:29.268Z,My parents barely know how to sign into a computer.
25,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76365b,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:59:32.561Z,"But I still say at the end of the day, it doesn't take much for the husband to help. And older people have a harder time learning languages."
25,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762efd,snappyMonkey,2020-04-22T20:59:38.742Z,"She said he he has also been incredibly helpful in bridging cultural gaps., so he has been helpful."
25,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76365b,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T21:00:31.459Z,"I think she's not necessarily in the right, but I wouldn't call her an asshole. "
25,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f0a,niceCow,2020-04-22T21:00:34.448Z,I would hope that my partner would be willing to help my parents out
25,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762efd,snappyMonkey,2020-04-22T21:00:59.888Z,Just depends on how often.
25,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763e1b,snappyLion,2020-04-22T21:01:11.291Z,"In the long term, it is better for the parents to try to learn English. It could just be maybe like once or twice a week."
25,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f0a,niceCow,2020-04-22T21:01:20.328Z,I noticed she indicated it was 10 minutes every once in awhile.  I would hate to think that my partner wasn't willing to give up 10 minutes to help my parents out.
25,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76365b,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T21:01:32.292Z,They could be in the process of learning English but still need the occasional help translating.
25,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76365b,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T21:01:58.812Z,"So given that, I still say she's not the asshole."
25,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763e1b,snappyLion,2020-04-22T21:02:07.680Z,"Yeah for sure, its not an issue for harder issues but maybe it is the trivial things throughout the day that frustrate him"
25,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762efd,snappyMonkey,2020-04-22T21:02:21.108Z,I'm inclined to say she is not the asshole.
25,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f0a,niceCow,2020-04-22T21:02:26.366Z,I don't believe she is the asshole
25,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76365b,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T21:02:36.234Z,I don't think she's the asshole either.
25,3,5d482ea921c9be351f763728,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T21:02:47.757Z,I agree she's not the asshole.
26,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762ef8,culturedWolf,2020-04-22T20:15:59.990Z,this person is the asshole
26,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762fd0,littleRhino,2020-04-22T20:16:06.942Z,yup that's what I thought too
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634b2,smallRabbit,2020-04-22T20:16:12.508Z,I agree as well. 
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyCow,2020-04-22T20:16:23.741Z,I think she's only asking for a little bit of time from him
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyCow,2020-04-22T20:16:33.652Z,She is working and going to school.  He is free.
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634fb,spryBear,2020-04-22T20:16:38.151Z,I disagree that she is the asshole. I don't think either of them are necessarily.
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634b2,smallRabbit,2020-04-22T20:16:46.745Z,Sounds like it has gotten to be more than a little bit of time though. 
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76333b,newDonkey,2020-04-22T20:16:50.294Z,I agree as well. I think she was tired of translating and put it on him.
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyCow,2020-04-22T20:16:52.525Z,"Yes, they both have good points."
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyCow,2020-04-22T20:17:06.116Z,I think there is room for compromise here.
26,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762ef8,culturedWolf,2020-04-22T20:17:11.395Z,certainly
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634b2,smallRabbit,2020-04-22T20:17:27.333Z,"Sure there is, but if we have to decide one way or another i this she is the arse here. "
26,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762ef8,culturedWolf,2020-04-22T20:17:31.851Z,she should make it so that he's not 100% taking these calls
26,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762fd0,littleRhino,2020-04-22T20:17:37.797Z,yeah
26,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762ef8,culturedWolf,2020-04-22T20:17:40.229Z,"i guarantee she has ten minutes to spare every day, just as he does"
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634fb,spryBear,2020-04-22T20:17:49.007Z,Yeah it's hard to say. I do think she should ask him how he felt about it before putting it on him
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyCow,2020-04-22T20:17:50.495Z,That would be more fair
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76333b,newDonkey,2020-04-22T20:17:54.517Z,The family has been here a long time and need to be learning English
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76312e,conventionalGoat,2020-04-22T20:18:01.669Z,I think she shouldn't just assume that he is willing to help just because he also speaks Spanish too
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyCow,2020-04-22T20:18:19.826Z,"At the same time, she makes a good point that he is their family too"
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634fb,spryBear,2020-04-22T20:18:39.171Z,"Agreed, they both clearly don't want to do it, and it is rude that she assumes he will do it."
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76333b,newDonkey,2020-04-22T20:18:44.508Z,He has a right to his feeling about the situation 
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634b2,smallRabbit,2020-04-22T20:18:50.875Z,Then as a family they should discuss how to move forward as it doesn't sound like it is working for them right now. 
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyCow,2020-04-22T20:18:59.467Z,"She's asking him to share the load, that's all."
26,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762ef8,culturedWolf,2020-04-22T20:19:23.059Z,they may share equal blame too
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76333b,newDonkey,2020-04-22T20:19:30.613Z,It does sound like they are communicating. Which means that he has heard her out.
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634b2,smallRabbit,2020-04-22T20:19:30.960Z,She has asked him to take on the load not share it
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76312e,conventionalGoat,2020-04-22T20:19:36.508Z,"However, they should come up with a system that works for both of them."
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634fb,spryBear,2020-04-22T20:19:44.444Z,I think they both could have been more communicative
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyCow,2020-04-22T20:19:45.466Z,I think they could work together and the parents could take English lessons as a compromise too
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634b2,smallRabbit,2020-04-22T20:19:54.909Z,Agree
26,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762fd0,littleRhino,2020-04-22T20:20:09.423Z,"Right, it's fine every once in a while. But if he's doing it the vast majority of the time, it's not really fair."
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyCow,2020-04-22T20:20:15.241Z,Communication is key.  You're right.
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76333b,newDonkey,2020-04-22T20:20:21.569Z,They should get the parents an English coarse to help them learn English 
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76312e,conventionalGoat,2020-04-22T20:20:33.157Z,"Definitely, they could communicate with her mother to share that they don't always have time to help, but they will help when they can. "
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634fb,spryBear,2020-04-22T20:20:35.132Z,But it's hard to say who is more at fault for the lack of communication. What do you guys think?
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyCow,2020-04-22T20:20:40.037Z,"I agree, newDonkey"
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyCow,2020-04-22T20:21:04.116Z,"I think both probably are at fault, but the husband sounds kind of like a whiner."
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634b2,smallRabbit,2020-04-22T20:21:21.799Z,She is at fault because expectations were not set before she started up schooling. If they had discussed this in dvance it wouldn't be an issue. 
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76312e,conventionalGoat,2020-04-22T20:21:38.864Z,"In a lot of countries, family helping each other out is just a cultural assumption. "
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634fb,spryBear,2020-04-22T20:21:51.246Z,I agree smallRabbit She even shot down is alternative solutions he gave
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyCow,2020-04-22T20:21:58.372Z,I'm inclined to believe that she is partly to blame but is not an asshole.  They both need to communicate and work on a solution.
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76333b,newDonkey,2020-04-22T20:22:03.195Z,A marriage is about five and take and this is something that they will need to workout to find a compromise for I do think she is the asshole for just assuming but it doesn’t make her a bad person 
26,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76312e,conventionalGoat,2020-04-22T20:22:07.567Z,I think maybe the pressure she is putting on her husband comes from her heritage. 
26,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762ef8,littleOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:45:51.327Z,this guy is probably the asshole
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7634b2,conventionalPig,2020-04-22T20:45:57.970Z,The tone it what got me on this. 
26,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762fd0,youngGoat,2020-04-22T20:46:08.522Z,yeah I felt that too
26,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762ef8,littleOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:46:09.461Z,im not sure that he would be the asshole if the tone was more polite
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7634b2,conventionalPig,2020-04-22T20:46:13.969Z,"I get being frustrated about the situation, but there is a right way and a wrong way to deal with it"
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:46:14.167Z,"His tone isn't good, but he has some points."
26,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762ef8,littleOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:46:15.188Z,but i doubt that he was polite with his mother in law
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f76312e,nicePanda,2020-04-22T20:46:30.017Z,"This one is a little complicated. I think even if his tone with her was kind, the inner tone would still come through."
26,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762ef8,littleOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:46:31.001Z,"and this is exactly the type of situation where being polite might get your way, and he blows it"
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:46:44.407Z,I think he is trying to find a way to approach it better.
26,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762ef8,littleOrangutan,2020-04-22T20:47:01.689Z,however the idea that his ability to learn multiple languages in a relatively short time would equate to his MIL doing the same is ridiculous
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:47:16.109Z,"I think wanting them to try is fair, however."
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7634b2,conventionalPig,2020-04-22T20:47:28.321Z,"Well, still 8 years is a long time...."
26,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762fd0,youngGoat,2020-04-22T20:47:40.114Z,"And it wasn't like the mother was calling him all the time, only when she couldn't get a hold of her family. "
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f76312e,nicePanda,2020-04-22T20:47:43.738Z,"Definitely. People learn languages at different paces. Some people are really good at it, others are not. "
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7634b2,conventionalPig,2020-04-22T20:48:08.214Z,"Still, what would the mother do if she can't get a hold of anyone and it is an emergency?"
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:48:18.847Z,There is still a certain amount of effort they should be putting into the process.
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7634b2,conventionalPig,2020-04-22T20:48:40.153Z,"Agreed, but they need to discuss it as a family to decide how to move forward. "
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:48:50.406Z,"I think his tone is annoying, but I don't think he's an asshole."
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f76312e,nicePanda,2020-04-22T20:49:00.815Z,"I think, it would be good to encourage the MIL to do more things on her own when she can so that he is empowering her to be more independent, but also understand more of where she is coming from."
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:49:28.167Z,"True, nice"
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f76312e,nicePanda,2020-04-22T20:51:00.340Z,"I think he is the a, but only because his heart towards his MIL is not very good. He could be more understanding  and less frustrated by her asking for help. "
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f76312e,nicePanda,2020-04-22T20:51:27.222Z,He should have the freedom to voice when he doesn't have much time though. 
26,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763209,snappyGiraffe,2020-04-22T20:51:51.815Z,"I think he could use some personal skills in handling this, but I don't think his feelings are invalid."
27,1,5e9f366c9dc0406f8987761f,niceGoat,2020-04-22T20:57:36.748Z,"I think in this scenario, she makes a great point that her mother is now his family too."
27,1,5e9f38249dc0406f8987768b,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T20:58:07.917Z,"I think they are all adults. The husband does not have to answer the phone. He can call her back, request a time, ask for an email, and more. Her mother is a part of the family now."
27,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762eeb,youngGorilla,2020-04-22T20:58:10.820Z,I think the husband should be willing to help. He is part of the family now and if the wife is busy he should help if he can. 
27,1,5e9f38249dc0406f8987768b,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T20:58:20.107Z,Agree niceGoat
27,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b2d,smallRhino,2020-04-22T20:58:21.546Z,I don’t think she is the asshole. Her husband speaks Spanish too so it isn’t that hard for him to translate. He said some very racist things about her parents not learning English. I think the husband is definitely being an asshole.
27,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f76399c,likelyHippo,2020-04-22T20:58:25.541Z,"I believe she is not an asshole. She believes that he married her and her family. By not being willing to translate (every so once in a while) she is hurt. He does not recognize the hurt, which makes him the asshole."
27,1,5e9f38249dc0406f8987768b,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T20:58:29.090Z,Agree youngGorilla
27,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7631eb,snappyPanda,2020-04-22T20:58:42.507Z,I totally agree. She is not an asshole for it after all he is apart of the family now
27,1,5e9f38249dc0406f8987768b,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T20:58:50.113Z,Agree likelyHippo
27,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763194,snappyBison,2020-04-22T20:58:51.425Z,"Okay, I believe that the husband should make an effort to help out. When you marry, you marry not only the other person, but the family"
27,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f76399c,likelyHippo,2020-04-22T20:59:00.036Z,I agree with everyone too
27,1,5e9f38249dc0406f8987768b,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T20:59:01.656Z,wow. we all agree!
27,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762eeb,youngGorilla,2020-04-22T20:59:02.209Z,If it is a problem for him then they should discuss a better option for the time in question. 
27,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762eeb,youngGorilla,2020-04-22T20:59:10.086Z,YAY
27,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b2d,smallRhino,2020-04-22T20:59:13.308Z,Agree with way you all are saying!
27,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763194,snappyBison,2020-04-22T20:59:16.071Z,Yes they should come to a compromise for sure
27,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7631eb,snappyPanda,2020-04-22T20:59:17.703Z,Exactly youngGorilla
27,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763194,snappyBison,2020-04-22T20:59:45.824Z,so she is not the asshole
27,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f76399c,likelyHippo,2020-04-22T20:59:51.659Z,"I think the key here is that they disagree on what marriage means, which set her up for being hurt in this situation. "
27,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b2d,smallRhino,2020-04-22T21:00:00.135Z,Not the asshole
27,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7631eb,snappyPanda,2020-04-22T21:00:02.090Z,correct snappyBison
27,1,5e9f38249dc0406f8987768b,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T21:00:05.937Z,not the asshole
27,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762eeb,youngGorilla,2020-04-22T21:00:06.558Z,not the asshole
27,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7631eb,snappyPanda,2020-04-22T21:00:12.868Z,not the asshole
27,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f76399c,likelyHippo,2020-04-22T21:00:24.022Z,There is definitely some cross cultural gaps that need to be bridged.
27,1,5e9f38249dc0406f8987768b,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T21:01:08.190Z,"Considering both sides, I am sure he is busy as everyone is. Mom can't call several times a day and expect to hear his voice"
27,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762eeb,youngGorilla,2020-04-22T21:01:13.416Z,The husband has right to feel the way he does but he should be more willing to make compromises that work for all parties and not be so selfish. I do understand his frustration just not his repsonse. 
27,1,5e9f38249dc0406f8987768b,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T21:01:21.990Z,agree
27,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f76399c,likelyHippo,2020-04-22T21:01:26.522Z,Agree
27,1,5e9f366c9dc0406f8987761f,niceGoat,2020-04-22T21:01:30.668Z,I also think with so many resources like google translate
27,1,5e9f38249dc0406f8987768b,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T21:01:45.947Z,Oh good point niceGoat lots of resources out there.
27,1,5e9f38249dc0406f8987768b,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T21:02:08.155Z,I also think the wife is correct that expecting them to learn the language at this point is unreasonable.
27,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762eeb,youngGorilla,2020-04-22T21:02:08.752Z,Mom might like playing with google :) 
27,1,5e9f366c9dc0406f8987761f,niceGoat,2020-04-22T21:02:16.160Z,But 10 minutes in order to help doesn't seem too bad
27,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762eeb,youngGorilla,2020-04-22T21:02:25.659Z,Agree culturedMonkey that is unreasonable at this point in their lives
27,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7631eb,snappyPanda,2020-04-22T21:02:25.913Z,Yes. There definitely should be more communication there and compromise. If he is busy he can consider a time convenient for him. 
27,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f76399c,likelyHippo,2020-04-22T21:02:32.643Z,"Even if he is stressed, his comment about her parents needing to learn english is hurtful. Why should they assimilate?"
27,1,5e9f366c9dc0406f8987761f,niceGoat,2020-04-22T21:02:36.319Z,"Yes, not everyone can learn a language easilt especially English which is hard"
27,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7631eb,snappyPanda,2020-04-22T21:02:38.157Z,After all he did start off at first helping.
27,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763194,snappyBison,2020-04-22T21:03:48.570Z,the women is not the asshole
27,1,5e9f38249dc0406f8987768b,culturedMonkey,2020-04-22T21:03:57.161Z,"In summary, she is not the asshole and he should help out family when he can."
27,3,5e9f366c9dc0406f8987761f,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-22T21:27:34.636Z,I think the guy is privillaged for thinking that anyone can learn english--it is a very difficult langauge to pick up.
27,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763194,youngDonkey,2020-04-22T21:27:42.968Z,I think this guy is the asshole. He is racist. He  is rude towards the wife
27,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631eb,smallCow,2020-04-22T21:27:46.093Z,I think that the Son in law could have been a bit more compassionate in expressing how he felt
27,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762eeb,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T21:27:54.651Z,He was very rude and disrespectful. He could have talked much nicer. He could compromise. Set up a certain time of the day he is availbable. 
27,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b2d,youngLion,2020-04-22T21:27:57.084Z,He’s an asshole. No 2 ways about it. The family has a right to say he’s being racist. His white make privileges are showing.
27,3,5e9f38249dc0406f8987768b,smallPanda,2020-04-22T21:27:58.873Z,The son-in-law is over-reacting to the situation. He is a member of the family. He needs to be more compassionate with them and understanding.
27,3,5e9f366c9dc0406f8987761f,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-22T21:28:01.817Z,Also the family is not asking for that much help
27,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631eb,smallCow,2020-04-22T21:28:25.032Z,He was an asshole for the words he spoke to his MIL
27,3,5e9f38249dc0406f8987768b,smallPanda,2020-04-22T21:28:32.792Z,"He has many options: he can not answer the call, ask for an email, ask for a text, coach them on some words, but really, he should understand that they need help."
27,3,5e9f366c9dc0406f8987761f,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-22T21:28:33.897Z,He obvioslly picks up languages easily but not everyone does
27,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b2d,youngLion,2020-04-22T21:28:41.303Z,Agree smallCow
27,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762eeb,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T21:28:50.443Z,Its a simple need and not hard to help with. He is just being an asshole. he is part of the family. how would he feel if someone was like that with his mother
27,3,5e9f38249dc0406f8987768b,smallPanda,2020-04-22T21:28:51.181Z,agree
27,3,5e9f366c9dc0406f8987761f,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-22T21:29:09.199Z,I also agree
27,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b2d,youngLion,2020-04-22T21:29:21.258Z,Agree niceSquirrel
27,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f76399c,youngHorse,2020-04-22T21:29:32.261Z,"I disagree. I believe he is guilty of being an elitist and privileged, but not an asshole. If he genuinely does not want to help, and he wants to give them the resources to learn, I do think he was the right to that."
27,3,5e9f38249dc0406f8987768b,smallPanda,2020-04-22T21:29:38.381Z,"Considering all sides, maybe they are calling too many times per day or making too many asks?"
27,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631eb,smallCow,2020-04-22T21:30:06.331Z,Possibly smallPanda
27,3,5e9f366c9dc0406f8987761f,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-22T21:30:08.627Z,Do you not think he has an obligation to help his family?
27,3,5e9f38249dc0406f8987768b,smallPanda,2020-04-22T21:30:09.516Z,His reaction makes him an asshole.
27,3,5e9f366c9dc0406f8987761f,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-22T21:31:39.916Z,I agree with smallPanda
27,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762eeb,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T21:31:41.655Z,No two ways about it. He was an asshole. He could have been more kind to find a workable solution
27,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762eeb,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T21:32:09.866Z,the asshole part is how he reacted. 
27,3,5e9f366c9dc0406f8987761f,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-22T21:33:13.831Z,I think he is the asshole.
28,2,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,culturedRabbit,2020-04-22T23:48:22.688Z,"i think she is being an asshole. I think her logic that her parents are immigrants and they worked hard, therefore its an expectation her husband translate, is flawed"
28,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b0f,spryHippo,2020-04-22T23:48:24.346Z,I think the OP is the asshole because she is just passing off work she doesn't want to do to her husband.
28,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630e1,smallBison,2020-04-22T23:48:45.475Z,"I agree, I don't think she should expect her husband to automatically take responsibility without having a conversation."
28,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7633b5,culturedHorse,2020-04-22T23:48:58.917Z,The girl is the asshole in this case. Her husband should not be the sole helper for her mom. 
28,2,5ea0c87e9dc0406f898895c7,snappyBear,2020-04-22T23:49:09.867Z,Even if it's only for a few minutes? Also we don't know how often her parents call to ask for help.
28,2,5ea0c87e9dc0406f898895c7,snappyBear,2020-04-22T23:49:35.289Z,I do think her parents should try to learn a little English though for being here for so long.
28,2,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,culturedRabbit,2020-04-22T23:49:43.648Z,"i get the familial thing, but by expecting him to ""step up to the plate"" also just feels demanding on her part"
28,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7633b5,culturedHorse,2020-04-22T23:49:52.372Z,"That;s true. But it sounds as though it's frequently. And yes, they should be learning English."
28,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630e1,smallBison,2020-04-22T23:50:03.398Z,"Yeah I don't think the issue is how long, I think it's the principle of it"
28,2,5ea0969c9dc0406f8988301d,newGorilla,2020-04-22T23:50:17.169Z,I feel like this could be solved with more communication. They shouldn't feel entitled that the husband HAS to help.
28,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763eae,snappyLion,2020-04-22T23:50:20.808Z,I feel the husband is just getting tired of answering their requests. 
28,2,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,culturedRabbit,2020-04-22T23:50:25.284Z,"well i dont fault the parents for not learning english, but her expectation that she can just pass the call to her husband to assist feels weird to me"
28,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b0f,spryHippo,2020-04-22T23:50:33.230Z,"Also why does she not want to help her parents herself? It is bad enough when my parents call me for tech support in english, imagine your mother in law  needing that translated. She just doesnt want to do it herself"
28,2,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,culturedRabbit,2020-04-22T23:50:48.981Z,are you all bots?
28,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630e1,smallBison,2020-04-22T23:50:54.046Z,No
28,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b0f,spryHippo,2020-04-22T23:50:56.886Z,Nope i am human
28,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7633b5,culturedHorse,2020-04-22T23:50:59.426Z,I'm not a bot. 
28,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b0f,spryHippo,2020-04-22T23:51:04.770Z,......or are we?
28,2,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,culturedRabbit,2020-04-22T23:51:08.066Z,"anyway, she an asshole"
28,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630e1,smallBison,2020-04-22T23:51:11.479Z,^
28,2,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,culturedRabbit,2020-04-22T23:51:13.028Z,i think we all agree
28,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b0f,spryHippo,2020-04-22T23:51:16.654Z,yup agreed
28,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630e1,smallBison,2020-04-22T23:51:18.507Z,Guilty
28,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7633b5,culturedHorse,2020-04-22T23:51:21.025Z,I think so too.
28,2,5ea0c87e9dc0406f898895c7,snappyBear,2020-04-22T23:51:36.358Z,Yeah her being a full time student isn't an excuse to help her mom for a few minutes a day haha
28,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7633b5,culturedHorse,2020-04-22T23:51:54.209Z,She should step up for her own parents  more than he should.
28,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b0f,spryHippo,2020-04-22T23:51:54.460Z,so hows everyone day going? i am waiting for a cake to bake while doing this
28,2,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,culturedRabbit,2020-04-22T23:52:07.070Z,i am making a baked potato
28,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b0f,spryHippo,2020-04-22T23:52:13.945Z,oo delish
28,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7633b5,culturedHorse,2020-04-22T23:52:16.704Z,Fine here. Thanks for asking. 
28,2,5ea0c87e9dc0406f898895c7,snappyBear,2020-04-22T23:52:28.848Z,Made a coconut cream pie for scratch before this!
28,2,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,culturedRabbit,2020-04-22T23:52:33.050Z,has newGorilla said anything
28,2,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,culturedRabbit,2020-04-22T23:52:38.325Z,snappyBear
28,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630e1,smallBison,2020-04-22T23:52:44.930Z,More like oldGorilla
28,2,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,culturedRabbit,2020-04-22T23:53:01.219Z,we need unanimous decision!
28,2,5ea0c87e9dc0406f898895c7,snappyBear,2020-04-22T23:53:06.002Z,yeah they did
28,2,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,culturedRabbit,2020-04-22T23:53:09.541Z,oh woops lol
28,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630e1,smallBison,2020-04-22T23:53:13.610Z,:(
28,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7633b5,culturedHorse,2020-04-22T23:53:34.928Z,She is the asshole for assuming her husband should take the greater role.
28,3,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:03:01.214Z,"i think hes an asshole.  i get wheres hes coming from, but the way hes going about it is 100% asshole."
28,3,5ea0969c9dc0406f8988301d,niceGoat,2020-04-23T00:03:05.879Z,I think the way that this guy approached it and his mindset makes him the asshole
28,3,5ea0969c9dc0406f8988301d,niceGoat,2020-04-23T00:03:10.354Z,yep lol
28,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630e1,littleWolf,2020-04-23T00:03:15.691Z,"Yeah, I think his mindset makes him the asshole too"
28,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b0f,littleBison,2020-04-23T00:03:35.165Z,Yeah i think he might be leaving something out of the story with the way hes wording it
28,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7633b5,youngPig,2020-04-23T00:03:40.294Z,It sounds as though he has been thoughtful about i. He has asked her to learn English so she's not so dependent on him. Seems fair to me.
28,3,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:04:11.453Z,true there can be a difference in the way he spoke to his mother in law versus his true thougts
28,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630e1,littleWolf,2020-04-23T00:04:11.959Z,"Yes, but he wasn't genuinely looking out for her good, it was just a way for him to disguise his annoyance"
28,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763eae,niceBear,2020-04-23T00:04:24.794Z,I'm on this guy's side. It's probably getting old translating for this woman. He was being helpful recommending helping her learn English.
28,3,5ea0c87e9dc0406f898895c7,youngMonkey,2020-04-23T00:04:27.946Z,She can't even do basic errands without him so I would understand why he would be annoyed.
28,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b0f,littleBison,2020-04-23T00:04:33.777Z,"It is true she should be a little   more independant, but there has to be something that happened in between for them to call him an asshole trump supporter"
28,3,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:04:42.462Z,"but if hes so concerned, maybe something like - lets practice english together, or lets practice duoloingo together"
28,3,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:04:51.579Z,i think we can all agree we understand why hes annoyed and bothered
28,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630e1,littleWolf,2020-04-23T00:05:03.517Z,Yeah I agree with littleBison
28,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7633b5,youngPig,2020-04-23T00:05:08.180Z,"Anyone who is a Trump supporter is called an asshole. Yes, we can agree why he's annoyed."
28,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630e1,littleWolf,2020-04-23T00:05:14.621Z,I don't think we're getting a full story here
28,3,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:05:16.677Z,"but the way hes going about it -is an asshole way like saying stuff like ""its not that hard"""
28,3,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:05:58.166Z,"heres a difference between telling someome that youre sick of their shit, versus explaining that he cannot be translating everything"
28,3,5ea0c87e9dc0406f898895c7,youngMonkey,2020-04-23T00:06:09.815Z,It's true how he words it makes him an asshole but overall she should be learning English. They translate everything for her so she doesn't feel a need to learn.
28,3,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:06:23.233Z,its not the reason why hes mad that makes him an asshole - its how hes going about it
28,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630e1,littleWolf,2020-04-23T00:06:27.138Z,Wait who here doesn't think he's an asshole
28,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7633b5,youngPig,2020-04-23T00:06:39.796Z,Guy admitted at the end that he did not speak to her in the way he mentioned in the beginning. I don't think he's an asshole.
28,3,5ea0c87e9dc0406f898895c7,youngMonkey,2020-04-23T00:07:02.242Z,You shouldn't just go around telling people they need to learn English but the fact that she expects that she can use him as a translator all the time makes him not an asshole.
28,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b0f,littleBison,2020-04-23T00:07:03.593Z,"I dunno the way he wrote out that story sounds other wise, hes definately leaving out details "
28,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630e1,littleWolf,2020-04-23T00:07:24.616Z,I don't think because the mother is blameless suddenly makes him not an asshole too
28,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b0f,littleBison,2020-04-23T00:07:39.837Z,both people assholes yes i agree
28,3,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:07:45.647Z,i mean i get it - he prob feels used
28,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630e1,littleWolf,2020-04-23T00:07:58.812Z,but it isn't justification to also be somewhat of an asshole
28,3,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:08:13.830Z,"yeah, i agree - hes going about it all wrong"
28,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630e1,littleWolf,2020-04-23T00:08:15.176Z,there's just better ways to resolve this situation than a spontaneous moment in a phone call
28,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7633b5,youngPig,2020-04-23T00:08:19.232Z,Mother is too dependent. He was not an asshole. Just trying to get her to stand on her own two feet.
28,3,5ea0c87e9dc0406f898895c7,youngMonkey,2020-04-23T00:08:21.127Z,That's why I feel like he's not an asshole in this situation because she needs to know at least a little english for emergency situations
28,3,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:08:59.966Z,hope everyone is staying healthy and safe!

28,3,5ea0ca2c9dc0406f89889629,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:09:26.396Z,omg how did u add an emoji
28,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630e1,littleWolf,2020-04-23T00:09:34.952Z,copypaste
29,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763e96,spryRabbit,2020-04-22T23:09:00.523Z,My initial impression is that the person is the asshole in the situation.
29,0,5e9f147a9dc0406f898754ae,likelyLion,2020-04-22T23:09:10.270Z,"My initial impression is that no, this person is not an asshole. She is right that in marriage, your spouse's family becomes your family."
29,0,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,conventionalPig,2020-04-22T23:09:12.527Z,My initial response is they are not
29,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a60,culturedGorilla,2020-04-22T23:09:20.790Z,I think she is being a little bit of an asshole because she assumed her husband would take on translating without asking him frist
29,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f75,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T23:09:30.448Z,I don't think she is the asshole. The inconvenience of translating for a family member is less than the benefit gained from the person being able to navigate life.
29,0,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,conventionalPig,2020-04-22T23:09:37.500Z,No she asked him to help at first and the mom just started going to him
29,0,5e9f147a9dc0406f898754ae,likelyLion,2020-04-22T23:09:37.925Z,"And since they are part of the family, her husband should be willing to help out. "
29,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a7c,likelyBison,2020-04-22T23:09:38.686Z,My initial impression is not an asshole.
29,0,5ea0a8269dc0406f89885406,conventionalBear,2020-04-22T23:09:55.826Z,"i don't think she is an asshole, you help family."
29,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f75,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T23:09:58.590Z,"Well, it doesn't say she didn't ask him. This sounds like something they have discussed."
29,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763e96,spryRabbit,2020-04-22T23:09:59.595Z,I agree with culturedGorilla I think she should take into consideration what he feels before she just gives him tasks he doesn't want to do
29,0,5e9f147a9dc0406f898754ae,likelyLion,2020-04-22T23:10:17.902Z,And I would also think that her husband would be more understanding of cultural differences
29,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a60,culturedGorilla,2020-04-22T23:10:35.401Z,"This is tricky. Fam helps fam, but no on should be obligated to do so"
29,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f75,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T23:10:38.316Z,We know what he feels - he feels he doesn't want to because they should just learn to speak english
29,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640f7,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T23:10:54.522Z,My initial response was that yes she is being an asshole. She says her family came to America and want to live the American life. I think they need to compromise. 
29,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763e96,spryRabbit,2020-04-22T23:10:54.789Z,However I do think her husband is being an asshole based on how he handles the situation
29,0,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,conventionalPig,2020-04-22T23:11:02.227Z,He wasn't upset at helping at first from what it reads like but ever since the mom just started calling him for help is when it changed
29,0,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,conventionalPig,2020-04-22T23:11:11.675Z,I agree hubby is the butt
29,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a7c,likelyBison,2020-04-22T23:11:20.548Z,"I think the husband should've said something too, before he got irritated from translating for her parents."
29,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640f7,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T23:11:20.628Z,"Yes help family, but her parents can take some time and try to learn. "
29,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a7c,likelyBison,2020-04-22T23:11:35.679Z,snappyHorse
29,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a60,culturedGorilla,2020-04-22T23:11:38.220Z,I agree with conventionalPig and spryRabbit
29,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f75,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T23:11:40.663Z,Why is someone assuming they are not trying to learn? learning a language takes time /
29,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763e96,spryRabbit,2020-04-22T23:11:50.613Z,I think they are both in the wrong and kind of both being assholes
29,0,5e9f147a9dc0406f898754ae,likelyLion,2020-04-22T23:11:51.631Z,"I understand it may be a little annoying to have the mom calling a lot, but you make sacrifices"
29,0,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,conventionalPig,2020-04-22T23:12:03.134Z,I agree likelyLion
29,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f75,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T23:12:05.449Z,"even if you are learning you may not understand, for example, the instructions on a medicine which can have specialized language"
29,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640f7,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T23:12:13.039Z,"In the reading, she says they should have to learn on top it everything. I disagree. "
29,0,5e9f147a9dc0406f898754ae,likelyLion,2020-04-22T23:12:14.566Z,and that's true niceSquirrel learning does take time
29,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a60,culturedGorilla,2020-04-22T23:12:15.570Z,or legal documents!
29,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a7c,likelyBison,2020-04-22T23:12:36.261Z,"snappyHorse depending on her parents ages and the culture they came from, they may not learn English as quickly as others."
29,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640f7,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T23:12:36.317Z,*shouldnt
29,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763e96,spryRabbit,2020-04-22T23:12:42.790Z,I think maybe the problem is that she is not the asshole in the situation but the way she writes is making her come across as one
29,0,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,conventionalPig,2020-04-22T23:12:44.180Z,"i think the couple should sit down with parents and set up rules for calling - like how often, etc"
29,0,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,conventionalPig,2020-04-22T23:13:01.100Z,set up expectations so he still is helping but feels like he is being heard too
29,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f75,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T23:13:12.889Z,Yes that is a good idea to have boundaries such as when it's ok to call and when he is unavailable. that is reasonable.
29,0,5e9f147a9dc0406f898754ae,likelyLion,2020-04-22T23:13:13.758Z,"That's a good idea, have discussions and boundaries that could work for everyone"
29,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640f7,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T23:13:14.395Z,"I agree with conventionalPig Times, days ect"
29,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a60,culturedGorilla,2020-04-22T23:13:17.129Z,they are both being assholeish due to lack of communication
29,0,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,conventionalPig,2020-04-22T23:13:40.661Z,so to me not an asshole
29,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a60,culturedGorilla,2020-04-22T23:13:50.283Z,So! who is the asshole?
29,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f75,niceSquirrel,2020-04-22T23:13:59.207Z,"I agree, the writer is not the asshole."
29,0,5e9f147a9dc0406f898754ae,likelyLion,2020-04-22T23:14:05.417Z,"Same, I don't believe she's being an asshole"
29,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a7c,likelyBison,2020-04-22T23:14:18.638Z,"In conclusion, both aren't assholes."
29,0,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,conventionalPig,2020-04-22T23:14:22.141Z,i think hubby's attitude is more being an asshole but the situation just needs boundaries
29,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640f7,snappyHorse,2020-04-22T23:14:28.728Z,"No one is the asshole, they just need to compromise and set boundaries. "
29,0,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,conventionalPig,2020-04-22T23:14:33.434Z,yes
29,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a60,culturedGorilla,2020-04-22T23:14:45.102Z,ok so we agree and non asshole! yay team
29,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a7c,likelyBison,2020-04-22T23:14:45.551Z,agree with snappyHorse
29,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762f75,smallGoat,2020-04-22T23:23:09.264Z,This guy is the asshole.
29,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e96,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T23:23:10.603Z,My initial impression is that he is the asshole
29,1,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,spryWolf,2020-04-22T23:23:20.918Z,I agree a complete butt
29,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e96,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T23:23:31.665Z,He also just has no idea what he did wrong 
29,1,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,spryWolf,2020-04-22T23:23:50.013Z,yes he does
29,1,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,spryWolf,2020-04-22T23:24:00.968Z,he just doesn't want to admit he is wrong
29,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a60,culturedHorse,2020-04-22T23:24:06.612Z,"Initially I thought he wasn't a butt, but, on a cultural level, you just don't do that kind of thing to your elderly inlaw's"
29,1,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,spryWolf,2020-04-22T23:24:07.286Z,that is why he id defensive
29,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762f75,smallGoat,2020-04-22T23:24:10.790Z,yeah seems like he lacks empathy and doesn't understand why other people's situation is different than his.
29,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a7c,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-22T23:24:18.432Z,"My initial impression is an asshole but I realized on his ""edit"" that he said it in a nicer way to her. "
29,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7640f7,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T23:24:22.338Z,My initial thought was he is an asshole. At the end though when he edited to say he was polite and had a nice tone then I am not so sure. 
29,1,5e9f147a9dc0406f898754ae,conventionalBison,2020-04-22T23:24:23.176Z,"It's interesting to see the scenario we previously looked at from the other side. Even with that though, hearing his side, he's still an asshole. "
29,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762f75,smallGoat,2020-04-22T23:24:32.942Z,Yep
29,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a60,culturedHorse,2020-04-22T23:24:39.220Z,agree with conventionalBison
29,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762f75,smallGoat,2020-04-22T23:25:05.203Z,sounds like we already agree
29,1,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,spryWolf,2020-04-22T23:25:14.956Z,looks like it
29,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a60,culturedHorse,2020-04-22T23:25:17.175Z,Well that was easy
29,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e96,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T23:25:19.575Z,Yup sounds like there's not much need  to debate
29,1,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,spryWolf,2020-04-22T23:25:19.791Z,lol

29,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e96,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T23:25:44.825Z,It sounded like he was getting attacked and wanted to defend himself
29,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a7c,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-22T23:25:45.293Z,"True, conventionalMonkey"
29,1,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,spryWolf,2020-04-22T23:25:52.617Z,"he may have been honest in the edit, people get heated when they rethink things"
29,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a7c,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-22T23:25:59.203Z,i mean conventionalBison
29,1,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,spryWolf,2020-04-22T23:26:01.282Z,especially if he is getting crap from the family
29,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7640f7,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T23:26:01.828Z,True. Someone got on him. 
29,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a60,culturedHorse,2020-04-22T23:26:18.008Z,"(also, not everyone knows the USA doesn't have an official language. in fact, most don't)"
29,1,5de2ba46b50e5a679ae873f9,spryWolf,2020-04-22T23:26:29.937Z,I always thought it was English
29,1,5e9f147a9dc0406f898754ae,conventionalBison,2020-04-22T23:26:37.423Z,I think we all considered both sides here
29,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762f75,smallGoat,2020-04-22T23:26:46.566Z,yep

29,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7640f7,likelyDonkey,2020-04-22T23:26:52.481Z,Agreed
29,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a60,culturedHorse,2020-04-22T23:26:59.617Z,"spryWolf one would think, but there is no official, federal language"
29,1,5e9f147a9dc0406f898754ae,conventionalBison,2020-04-22T23:27:02.854Z,"Nope, there's no official language. But obvious most of us speak English, and only English"
29,1,5e9f147a9dc0406f898754ae,conventionalBison,2020-04-22T23:27:11.171Z,obviously*
29,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a7c,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-22T23:27:27.964Z,US is full of different languages. There's no official language.
29,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e96,smallGiraffe,2020-04-22T23:28:05.926Z,I read somewhere that English is the hardest language to learn which completely negates his argument about him learning other languages in a yeat
29,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762f75,smallGoat,2020-04-22T23:28:08.544Z,"even if it was the official language, learning a new language is still a process"

29,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762f75,smallGoat,2020-04-22T23:28:28.547Z,yeah plus sometimes people say they learned a language in a year but really they are not fluent like a native speaker
29,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a7c,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-22T23:28:52.335Z,I conclude that he is an asshole then.
29,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a60,culturedHorse,2020-04-22T23:28:55.957Z,yep
29,1,5e9f147a9dc0406f898754ae,conventionalBison,2020-04-22T23:28:57.393Z,"We agree, the person is an asshole"

30,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763fb1,niceRabbit,2020-04-22T22:57:40.801Z,Hi
30,0,5ea06bb89dc0406f8987c3bf,newSquirrel,2020-04-22T22:57:42.597Z,Hi
30,0,5ea0a13c9dc0406f89883cf0,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T22:57:43.300Z,Hello!
30,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eaf,spryOrangutan,2020-04-22T22:57:46.465Z,Hi
30,0,5ea0a7ae9dc0406f898851f0,niceBear,2020-04-22T22:57:53.574Z,so she's the ah
30,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763fb1,niceRabbit,2020-04-22T22:58:17.915Z,I think so too. I don't think he should be expected to help all the time.
30,0,5ea0a7869dc0406f89885172,youngGiraffe,2020-04-22T22:58:17.920Z,"I think we've all been annoyed at some point when our parents ask us for help with something again and again. We help them anyway though, if we can. I'm talking stuff like tech support or legal documents."
30,0,5ea07c529dc0406f8987f80b,culturedGoat,2020-04-22T22:58:21.184Z,"I feel like the person is the asshole because he is the buffer between his parents and his spouse. With any issue between a married couple, family is usually, for me, a hot button issue. "
30,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eaf,spryOrangutan,2020-04-22T22:58:27.688Z,I think she's being a bit of an AH - they are her parents and it seems like she's dumped all the responsibility on her husband.
30,0,5ea0a13c9dc0406f89883cf0,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T22:58:34.971Z,I agree. I understand being busy but she needs to help too
30,0,5ea0a7869dc0406f89885172,youngGiraffe,2020-04-22T22:58:38.223Z,I'm inclined to agree that the husband should help. Especially because his reasoning seems so petty.
30,0,5ea0a7ae9dc0406f898851f0,niceBear,2020-04-22T22:58:39.067Z,she should not have just passed it off on him

30,0,5ea0a7869dc0406f89885172,youngGiraffe,2020-04-22T22:59:16.806Z,She's working full time and getting a Masters. That's a lot. It sounds like the husband doesn't have all that on his plate. 
30,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764111,smallPig,2020-04-22T22:59:25.389Z,Yeah she's really busy
30,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763fb1,niceRabbit,2020-04-22T22:59:26.097Z,It is just the part where she pased the full responsibility to him all the time that bugs me.
30,0,5ea07c529dc0406f8987f80b,culturedGoat,2020-04-22T22:59:31.384Z,She seems over sensitive about the immigrant issue and not on the issue of her wanting her husband to drop everything every time her parents need something translated. 
30,0,5ea0a7869dc0406f89885172,youngGiraffe,2020-04-22T22:59:32.668Z,Why not be happy his mother in law has a relationship with him and that he can help his wife?
30,0,5ea0a7ae9dc0406f898851f0,niceBear,2020-04-22T22:59:34.049Z,it is a lot but she shouldn't underestimate his job
30,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eaf,spryOrangutan,2020-04-22T22:59:37.452Z,It would be better if she could at least ask him to help then he would not feel so put upon.  It's a two way street

30,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eaf,spryOrangutan,2020-04-22T23:00:11.488Z,It just seems like she's not respecting that he's busy as well

30,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eaf,spryOrangutan,2020-04-22T23:00:53.954Z,She should be more considerate of her husband and they should try to work it out.

30,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763fb1,niceRabbit,2020-04-22T23:01:07.028Z,I can also see her point. But I think she is being unreasonable. The guys has put up with a lot.
30,0,5ea07c529dc0406f8987f80b,culturedGoat,2020-04-22T23:01:13.406Z,I would not want to put my husband in the same position if it were my parents that needed something. I would want to be the buffer and would try to not make him feel put out.
30,0,5ea0a7ae9dc0406f898851f0,niceBear,2020-04-22T23:01:17.262Z,yes I agree they need to work out maybe times it's ok to call for help
30,0,5ea0a7869dc0406f89885172,youngGiraffe,2020-04-22T23:01:19.086Z,How has he put up with a lot?

30,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eaf,spryOrangutan,2020-04-22T23:01:36.024Z,I still believe she's being somewhat unreasonable and taking advantage of him.

30,0,5ea0a13c9dc0406f89883cf0,conventionalLion,2020-04-22T23:02:00.167Z,I disagree with the husband saying the family needs to learn English but there needs to be balance.

30,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eaf,spryOrangutan,2020-04-22T23:02:19.326Z,I agree with culturedGoat

30,2,5d482eab21c9be351f764111,niceHippo,2020-04-22T23:27:24.871Z,I sympathize with this guy because my mom usually comes to ask me for translation help all the time. This is why I feel that multi-generational families usually depend on each other when it comes to translations.
30,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763fb1,culturedGorilla,2020-04-22T23:27:27.323Z,I think this guy sounds like an asshole the way he asked his question. But I think he might have been more respectful in person.

31,1,5e9f3b1c9dc0406f89877985,littleDonkey,2020-04-23T00:03:01.846Z,I feel like overall they all could've made more of an effort to connect with each other
31,1,5ea0ce1e9dc0406f898899ba,culturedBear,2020-04-23T00:03:07.021Z,agreed
31,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763452,niceGiraffe,2020-04-23T00:03:09.113Z,Yes i agree
31,1,5e9f3b1c9dc0406f89877985,littleDonkey,2020-04-23T00:03:43.107Z,So how do we determine which side we are on lol because it is actually very easy to see both
31,1,5ea0cefa9dc0406f89889adc,smallMonkey,2020-04-23T00:03:45.855Z,I agree also. 
31,1,5ea0ce1e9dc0406f898899ba,culturedBear,2020-04-23T00:03:53.278Z,I dont think she was an asshole
31,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763452,niceGiraffe,2020-04-23T00:04:02.758Z,I would lean toward saying they are
31,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763936,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-23T00:04:03.713Z,I agree culturedBear

31,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763452,niceGiraffe,2020-04-23T00:04:49.214Z,She could've done it more discreetly or let them be comfortable for a time before interjecting
31,1,5e9f3b1c9dc0406f89877985,littleDonkey,2020-04-23T00:04:58.055Z,I agree nice
31,1,5ea0cefa9dc0406f89889adc,smallMonkey,2020-04-23T00:05:34.442Z,"Well it did say that the partner rarely spoke French during the stay, so she probably had had enough. "
31,1,5e9f3b1c9dc0406f89877985,littleDonkey,2020-04-23T00:05:47.054Z,And she did say she knows he can speak english
31,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763452,niceGiraffe,2020-04-23T00:05:50.160Z,"I think that we need more context. Even though it wasn't unreasonable to ask them to speak english, there may have been a better opportunity to do so"
31,1,5e9f3b1c9dc0406f89877985,littleDonkey,2020-04-23T00:05:52.362Z,Which matters a lot
31,1,5e9f3b1c9dc0406f89877985,littleDonkey,2020-04-23T00:05:57.184Z,Agreed

31,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763452,newHorse,2020-04-23T00:29:48.082Z,I think that this person was doing the best they could with the given situation and it's not really their fault
31,3,5e9f3b1c9dc0406f89877985,niceBison,2020-04-23T00:29:53.567Z,I agree new

31,3,5ea0ce1e9dc0406f898899ba,culturedCow,2020-04-23T00:30:07.410Z,He should have communicated this with his mom
31,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763936,newRhino,2020-04-23T00:30:10.288Z,I think they should try to make the host comfortable and included
31,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763452,newHorse,2020-04-23T00:30:13.575Z,As long as they are spending some amount of time with the mother
31,3,5ea0ce1e9dc0406f898899ba,culturedCow,2020-04-23T00:30:22.517Z,I agree with newRhino
31,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763452,newHorse,2020-04-23T00:30:22.977Z,they should also be able to speak together in the other language
31,3,5ea0cefa9dc0406f89889adc,snappyPanda,2020-04-23T00:30:35.902Z,"I think this person is kind of an asshole. If his husband CAN speak English, they should speak English in the mother's home in order for her to feel included. "
31,3,5ea0ce1e9dc0406f898899ba,culturedCow,2020-04-23T00:30:58.904Z,i agree with snappyPanda
31,3,5ea0ce1e9dc0406f898899ba,culturedCow,2020-04-23T00:31:09.401Z,he only is in US for a short period of time
31,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763452,newHorse,2020-04-23T00:31:10.064Z,Well he CAN but not as comfortable
31,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763936,newRhino,2020-04-23T00:31:23.198Z,Agreed snappyPanda
31,3,5e9f3b1c9dc0406f89877985,niceBison,2020-04-23T00:31:24.711Z,"I think that they should try to include her in conversation yes, and they could've conveyed to the mother that he is not super comfortable with speaking english so that she could be more understanding"
31,3,5ea0ce1e9dc0406f898899ba,culturedCow,2020-04-23T00:31:31.235Z,If hes in someone elses house he should make them comfortable
31,3,5ea0ce1e9dc0406f898899ba,culturedCow,2020-04-23T00:31:44.392Z,They needed to communicate that with her
31,3,5e9f3b1c9dc0406f89877985,niceBison,2020-04-23T00:31:57.795Z,"But at the same time, it's difficult because he is stuck between trying to make his husband comfortable and trying to make his mom comfortable"
31,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763936,newRhino,2020-04-23T00:31:59.723Z,That is true niceBison. There should have been more communication
31,3,5e9f3b1c9dc0406f89877985,niceBison,2020-04-23T00:32:16.422Z,"And my unpopular opinion is that when you marry someone, they become first priority"
31,3,5ea0ce1e9dc0406f898899ba,culturedCow,2020-04-23T00:32:18.956Z,I see both sides but its just manners and etiques
31,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763936,newRhino,2020-04-23T00:32:19.871Z,It should always be best to respect the host
31,3,5ea0cefa9dc0406f89889adc,snappyPanda,2020-04-23T00:32:19.982Z,"Speaking some German is fine, but not all German, it's rude to the mother. If they all speak English, then everyone can understand the conversations. If German is spoken, that leaves someone out every time. "
31,3,5e9f3b1c9dc0406f89877985,niceBison,2020-04-23T00:32:30.777Z,So making his husband comfortable was potentially more important.
31,3,5ea0ce1e9dc0406f898899ba,culturedCow,2020-04-23T00:32:59.326Z,It rude to make someone feel uncomfortable in their own house though
31,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763936,newRhino,2020-04-23T00:33:17.008Z,Exactly snappyPanda and culturedCow
31,3,5e9f3b1c9dc0406f89877985,niceBison,2020-04-23T00:33:17.061Z,"I agree they should have probably made a larger effort to speak more english and convey that the husband was uncomfortable to his mother, but I still don't not know that this miscommunication makes him an asshole"
31,3,5ea0cefa9dc0406f89889adc,snappyPanda,2020-04-23T00:33:26.288Z,"The German husband CAN speak and understand English, he should make it a point to communicate with his mother-in-law, not exclude her. "
31,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763936,newRhino,2020-04-23T00:33:43.125Z,It is not an asshole but the asshole.
31,3,5ea0ce1e9dc0406f898899ba,culturedCow,2020-04-23T00:33:47.365Z,It makes him an asshole because he feels like his mom should automatically get it
31,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763452,newHorse,2020-04-23T00:33:51.875Z,"Right, more communication from both sides is always good, and they were stuck between two frustrating options"
31,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763936,newRhino,2020-04-23T00:33:53.556Z,In other words is he in the wrong here?
31,3,5e9f3b1c9dc0406f89877985,niceBison,2020-04-23T00:34:00.552Z,I suppose the other side is that he is not going to get more comfortable if he does not try to speak more english with her
31,3,5ea0ce1e9dc0406f898899ba,culturedCow,2020-04-23T00:34:15.586Z,"shes older, his mother in law, and its her house"
31,3,5ea0ce1e9dc0406f898899ba,culturedCow,2020-04-23T00:34:22.164Z,he should make her more comfortable
31,3,5ea0cefa9dc0406f89889adc,snappyPanda,2020-04-23T00:34:26.379Z,"Good point, niceBison "
31,3,5ea0ce1e9dc0406f898899ba,culturedCow,2020-04-23T00:34:44.346Z,they needed to communicate better
31,3,5ea0cefa9dc0406f89889adc,snappyPanda,2020-04-23T00:34:47.892Z,I agree with culturedCow
31,3,5e9f3b1c9dc0406f89877985,niceBison,2020-04-23T00:34:59.743Z,Why does her being older make him obligated to speak more english though?

32,1,5ea0d1529dc0406f89889dde,culturedCow,2020-04-23T00:16:26.248Z,I think this person is the asshole. Her husband shouldn't be obligated to translate every time she asks
32,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b3,youngGorilla,2020-04-23T00:16:36.891Z,It seems that the poster just sort of dumped this translation responsibility into her partner's lap without having a conversation about it.

32,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f0a,smallGoat,2020-04-23T00:17:08.984Z,"to help the in-laws simply because they are in-laws. If he tries to set a boundary, then it needs to be respected even"
32,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763550,niceHippo,2020-04-23T00:17:11.064Z,I think she should call her daughter first and ask if the husband is free and willing to help at the moment
32,1,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,littleHorse,2020-04-23T00:17:11.885Z,"I get that he should feel like helping sometimes, but it sounds like it has become an obligation for sure. What makes her time more valuable than his?"

32,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f0a,smallGoat,2020-04-23T00:17:20.088Z,if the other partner is working more.
32,1,5ea0d24c9dc0406f89889f5f,youngOrangutan,2020-04-23T00:17:27.768Z,I don't think it's difficult for him to translate since he knows Spanish and it's helping out his family
32,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b3,youngGorilla,2020-04-23T00:17:49.270Z,"It's not a question of the difficulty of the translation, but the assumption that he is obligated to do so."
32,1,5ea0d1529dc0406f89889dde,culturedCow,2020-04-23T00:17:57.556Z,I agree gor
32,1,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,littleHorse,2020-04-23T00:18:01.700Z,It probably isn't difficult for him overall. It sounds like he is resentful of the obligation. I'm not sure that makes his wife an asshole
32,1,5ea0d24c9dc0406f89889f5f,youngOrangutan,2020-04-23T00:18:13.647Z,Okay I'll agree that he shouldn't be demanded to translate every time.
32,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f0a,smallGoat,2020-04-23T00:18:15.277Z,"I didn't get the impression it was difficult, either"
32,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b3,youngGorilla,2020-04-23T00:18:26.764Z,"Because now he is ""volun-told"" to do this task."

32,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763550,niceHippo,2020-04-23T00:18:48.328Z,I think the mother is imposing herself too much but she cant help it. I think it is okay if the wife is working more than her husband and he has more time he should help it
32,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b3,youngGorilla,2020-04-23T00:19:01.222Z,"I think that if he doesn't see this as being forced on him, he would be more likely to volunteer to help in the future--on his own terms."
32,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763550,niceHippo,2020-04-23T00:19:06.334Z,i hope that makes the daughter happy as well

32,1,5ea0d24c9dc0406f89889f5f,youngOrangutan,2020-04-23T00:19:54.166Z,niceHippo what is holding you back
32,1,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,littleHorse,2020-04-23T00:20:18.673Z,So she's an asshole for basically calling HIM an asshole for not wanting to be constantly at someone's beck and call

32,1,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,littleHorse,2020-04-23T00:22:13.827Z,I still felt he should help... but her attitude irritates me
32,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b3,youngGorilla,2020-04-23T00:22:22.504Z,"That's the fun part of actually doing this on Reddit! I always like reading all the comments. But in this case, I think she's the asshole for assuming/demanding this."
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b3,littleBison,2020-04-23T00:45:59.771Z,I think the speaker's frustration in his words makes it hard to know what's actually happening here.
32,3,5ea0d24c9dc0406f89889f5f,youngCow,2020-04-23T00:46:02.814Z,"I think since the mom only asks the poster when no one else is available, poster is the asshole for getting so upset"
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,snappyWolf,2020-04-23T00:46:19.146Z,"Well, when I read the first part of this, I thought he was an asshole, but the edit at the bottom if true, shows he wasn't actually treating her badly"
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b3,littleBison,2020-04-23T00:46:22.692Z,"Good point, youngCow"
32,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f0a,spryHippo,2020-04-23T00:46:27.827Z,"I kind of feel like they're both being jerks, but the mother-in-law is overstepping her bounds and needs to respect her son-in-law's boundaries."
32,3,5ea0d1529dc0406f89889dde,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T00:46:36.271Z,Who does she ask when someone else is available? Did it give that information?
32,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763550,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:46:42.685Z,I think MIL is being a littleBison bit imposing here and the son is law is right about what he said
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,snappyWolf,2020-04-23T00:46:44.144Z,"I really hate when people throw ""white privilege"" in the mix"
32,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763550,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:46:57.624Z,I think it is about trying
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,snappyWolf,2020-04-23T00:46:58.919Z,"He's frustrated and it is a family issue, so why do that?"
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b3,littleBison,2020-04-23T00:47:01.325Z,"I do think it's unreasonable of him to say ""I learned a language super quickly and you can, too."" It's hard to do it!"
32,3,5ea0d24c9dc0406f89889f5f,youngCow,2020-04-23T00:47:03.820Z,"It says ""when she can't get ahold of other family members"""
32,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f0a,spryHippo,2020-04-23T00:47:04.384Z,"I think that's probably a real factor, though."
32,3,5ea0d1529dc0406f89889dde,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T00:47:08.950Z,Yes I am leaning towards siding with the poster
32,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763550,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:47:13.893Z,"just give it a try, you should be able to learn and he was willing to help"
32,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f0a,spryHippo,2020-04-23T00:47:13.946Z,"I agree with that, littleBison"
32,3,5ea0d1529dc0406f89889dde,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T00:47:26.612Z,They called him a trump supporter and racist. seems disrespectful to do that
32,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763550,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:47:39.416Z,true
32,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f0a,spryHippo,2020-04-23T00:47:39.443Z,"If they say that, it's most likely true"
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b3,littleBison,2020-04-23T00:47:41.920Z,"Yeah, that part insulting him was not cool"
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,snappyWolf,2020-04-23T00:47:49.510Z,"The mother has been in the country for 8 years, true, but if she is insulated in a Spanish speaking community, I can totally understand how she wouldn't have learned English well at all"
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b3,littleBison,2020-04-23T00:48:14.784Z,"If that part is true about what they said/how they treated him, it's a huge problem. But I'm not 100% sure I trust the poster based on the edit and his bias."
32,3,5ea0d24c9dc0406f89889f5f,youngCow,2020-04-23T00:48:18.961Z,"I think if he really phrased it how he did in the edit, that was a lot nicer and more reasonable"
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b3,littleBison,2020-04-23T00:48:23.627Z,"Good point, snappyWolf"
32,3,5ea0d1529dc0406f89889dde,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T00:48:30.572Z,Would a racist trump supporter really marry a latin woman and take the time to learn spanish and portuguese?
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,snappyWolf,2020-04-23T00:48:32.967Z,I honestly don't feel like he's an asshole at all and think he just got frustrated and she probably calls on him more than not
32,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763550,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:48:35.986Z,getting out of the bubble and learning everyday words with help from her SIL should not be that bad
32,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763550,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:48:53.334Z,yup..for almost everything
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,snappyWolf,2020-04-23T00:48:56.327Z,I agree smallRhino
32,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f0a,spryHippo,2020-04-23T00:49:05.758Z,But why did he learn Spanosh or portugese? He also learned Russian. Might now have had anything to
32,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f0a,spryHippo,2020-04-23T00:49:15.379Z,do with his wife's family
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,snappyWolf,2020-04-23T00:49:17.389Z,"I don't think she should be bashed for not learning English, but he shouldn't be bashed for not wanting to be a translator all the time"
32,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763550,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:49:18.222Z,witch hunt
32,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763550,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:49:20.065Z,lol
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b3,littleBison,2020-04-23T00:49:47.210Z,I feel like this would be an ESH (everyone sucks here) on actual Reddit
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,snappyWolf,2020-04-23T00:49:54.647Z,Likely so
32,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f0a,spryHippo,2020-04-23T00:50:09.920Z,"I agree that the wife and MIL are in the wrong here. It's not the husband's responsibility regardless of his beliefs about race or nationality, or his own race"
32,3,5ea0d1529dc0406f89889dde,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T00:50:12.029Z,It is also important to think about how an English speaker would feel if they immigrated to a foreign country and didn't speak the language. It is probably scary.
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,snappyWolf,2020-04-23T00:50:14.654Z,I think he is probably not the asshole and that obviously a nerve was plucked in the family over the whole thing
32,3,5ea0d24c9dc0406f89889f5f,youngCow,2020-04-23T00:50:17.803Z,I understand his frustration and wanting the mom to be independent.
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b3,littleBison,2020-04-23T00:50:26.071Z,"But since we have to choose one side or the other, I guess I'm learning toward not the asshole"
32,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f0a,spryHippo,2020-04-23T00:50:33.159Z,"I agree, littleBison littleBison Thank you for teaching me that term! lol"
32,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763550,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:50:45.103Z,I agree he is trying to make her MIL independent. I like that guy
32,3,5ea0d24c9dc0406f89889f5f,youngCow,2020-04-23T00:50:45.695Z,I agree
32,3,5ea0d1529dc0406f89889dde,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T00:50:58.483Z,so we are voting NTA?
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b3,littleBison,2020-04-23T00:51:00.880Z,Ha ha! :) AITA is a really fun forum on Reddit! I highly recommend it
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,snappyWolf,2020-04-23T00:51:01.172Z,"Yes, reading into that, he really sounds like he cares a lot about her"
32,3,5ea0d24c9dc0406f89889f5f,youngCow,2020-04-23T00:51:04.017Z,Yes
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,snappyWolf,2020-04-23T00:51:05.516Z,not an asshole!
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,snappyWolf,2020-04-23T00:51:07.626Z,lol
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b3,littleBison,2020-04-23T00:51:09.668Z,I would learn NTA in this case
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b3,littleBison,2020-04-23T00:51:13.990Z,*lean
32,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f0a,spryHippo,2020-04-23T00:51:41.372Z,"I hate not being able to vote ESH, but....I, too, lean NTA "
32,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76358a,snappyWolf,2020-04-23T00:52:30.377Z,So he's not an asshole and his family hopefully will get over themselves and apologize for calling him names like they did.
33,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bbc,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T00:21:00.975Z,hello
33,1,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T00:21:03.571Z,Hi
33,1,5e9dea329dc0406f89872538,youngGoat,2020-04-23T00:21:07.666Z,Hi
33,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e52,smallMonkey,2020-04-23T00:21:08.615Z,hi
33,1,5ea0d59e9dc0406f8988a5f0,youngBear,2020-04-23T00:21:16.377Z,Hello all
33,1,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,spryDonkey,2020-04-23T00:21:18.079Z,Hey
33,1,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T00:21:34.056Z,I think since the situation is only temporary while she get's her Master's it's ok.
33,1,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,spryDonkey,2020-04-23T00:21:47.848Z,"I dont think this person is the asshole lol, the husband should help he did marry her."
33,1,5ea0d59e9dc0406f8988a5f0,youngBear,2020-04-23T00:21:55.528Z,Poster is definitely not the asshole. Helping the MIL for a few minutes is part of being married.
33,1,5e9dea329dc0406f89872538,youngGoat,2020-04-23T00:22:02.310Z,I believe the poster is TA and she providers the argument why: she says it is only 10 minutes every once in a while that the mother calls.
33,1,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,spryDonkey,2020-04-23T00:22:11.624Z,Yep I agree youngBear
33,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bbc,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T00:22:17.087Z,I believe that the woman is not being the asshole because she is in school and if the translations are short it should not be a problem
33,1,5e9dea329dc0406f89872538,youngGoat,2020-04-23T00:22:28.965Z,"She expects her husband to have 10 minutes available, but she does not?"
33,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e52,smallMonkey,2020-04-23T00:22:30.137Z,do you think he is an asshole. i think he is because it only take a few minutes to help out
33,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763afc,littleRhino,2020-04-23T00:22:34.570Z,My inintial impression is that this person is not being an asshole. It will not kill the husband to help his in laws translate and help them with English. 
33,1,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T00:22:53.899Z,"I also don't think she's TA, they are family and this isn't to much of a hassle"
33,1,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,spryDonkey,2020-04-23T00:22:57.637Z,The husband should not mind helping out the in-laws every once in a while
33,1,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T00:23:13.062Z,Yes and he doesn't even have to get up to help
33,1,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,spryDonkey,2020-04-23T00:23:17.378Z,Sounds like he is a Big Asshole!
33,1,5ea0d59e9dc0406f8988a5f0,youngBear,2020-04-23T00:23:22.181Z,A smart husband will do small things like this to make his spouse happy! ;)
33,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bbc,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T00:23:40.213Z,If she is actually busy with college and the husband is just available i don't see a problem
33,1,5e9dea329dc0406f89872538,youngGoat,2020-04-23T00:23:50.952Z,"If the task of translating indeed does not take long and only occurs infrequently, then why can she not make any time for her mother. Is she really that busy that she cannot spare 10 minutes every so often?"
33,1,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T00:23:56.480Z,"Definitely, youngBear He should be more helpful like this while she gets through college"
33,1,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,spryDonkey,2020-04-23T00:23:59.143Z,Yes it's really no big deal and they did accept him into the family so why not help?
33,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e52,smallMonkey,2020-04-23T00:24:03.205Z,is the question on being an asshole referring to the husband?
33,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763afc,littleRhino,2020-04-23T00:24:06.595Z,She is busy in school and are not necessarily available when her parents need her while her husband is available
33,1,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T00:24:21.429Z,"I think it refers to the wife, who wrote the post."
33,1,5ea0d59e9dc0406f8988a5f0,youngBear,2020-04-23T00:24:27.354Z,smallMonkey the question is if the WIFE is TA
33,1,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,spryDonkey,2020-04-23T00:24:32.565Z,"No it is referring to the wife, but the husband is obviously a huge asshole lol"
33,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e52,smallMonkey,2020-04-23T00:24:40.132Z,then she is not an asshole. sorry
33,1,5e9dea329dc0406f89872538,youngGoat,2020-04-23T00:25:00.244Z,"I disagree, the wife is the asshole"
33,1,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T00:25:01.966Z,It sounds like many of us are agreeing that she is not TA.
33,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bbc,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T00:25:08.587Z,I do think the parents should learn english 
33,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763afc,littleRhino,2020-04-23T00:25:09.861Z,Agreed the husband is the asshole here
33,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e52,smallMonkey,2020-04-23T00:25:15.489Z,yes
33,1,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,spryDonkey,2020-04-23T00:25:18.538Z,All except young youngGoat I think
33,1,5ea0d59e9dc0406f8988a5f0,youngBear,2020-04-23T00:25:24.922Z,"I do think it would be fair if the husband occasionally said, not now, I'm busy, but that doesn't make the wife TA"
33,1,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T00:25:31.430Z,except for youngGoat
33,1,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,spryDonkey,2020-04-23T00:25:36.586Z,They should learn yes but damn he can help
33,1,5e9dea329dc0406f89872538,youngGoat,2020-04-23T00:25:50.993Z,But he has been helping.
33,1,5ea0d59e9dc0406f8988a5f0,youngBear,2020-04-23T00:26:02.113Z,"Or ""honey, there's no way I can talk to your mom tonight, can you talk to her?"""
33,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763afc,littleRhino,2020-04-23T00:26:04.553Z,The parents needs help though learning English and if the husband can help them why does he have a problem with it
33,1,5e9dea329dc0406f89872538,youngGoat,2020-04-23T00:26:31.241Z,"it is not that he said he will not help. He has been helping, but it has now reached a point that he wants a reprieve."
33,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e52,smallMonkey,2020-04-23T00:26:34.274Z,no
33,1,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T00:26:48.097Z,"Yes, he didn't need to accuse them of needing to learn English. It's harder when you're older to learn a language."
33,1,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,spryDonkey,2020-04-23T00:27:12.551Z,He should be greatful they accepted him into the family
33,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e52,smallMonkey,2020-04-23T00:27:30.392Z,time to decide i say no
33,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bbc,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T00:27:34.654Z,The parents should not care who is translating as logn as someone is doing it
33,1,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,spryDonkey,2020-04-23T00:27:39.086Z,No

33,2,5ea0d59e9dc0406f8988a5f0,youngRabbit,2020-04-23T00:35:57.214Z,Hello there
33,2,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-23T00:35:57.557Z,Hello
33,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763e52,culturedBear,2020-04-23T00:35:59.357Z,hi
33,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763afc,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:36:01.620Z,hello
33,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bbc,youngRhino,2020-04-23T00:36:07.977Z,I think the husband is not TA
33,2,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,snappyGorilla,2020-04-23T00:36:22.671Z,Well this is obviously the same story from the husbands perspective
33,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763afc,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:36:30.231Z,I don't think the husband is an asshole
33,2,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-23T00:36:33.476Z,I don't think it's his place to tell his MIL to learn English
33,2,5ea0d59e9dc0406f8988a5f0,youngRabbit,2020-04-23T00:36:33.633Z,"So, Husband definitely being an asshole here. Not trying to understand MIL and her trouble with english"
33,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763e52,culturedBear,2020-04-23T00:36:35.999Z,i believe  he is not asshole .  the mil needs to learn how to speak english.
33,2,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,snappyGorilla,2020-04-23T00:37:14.065Z,"I don't think he meant to be an ""asshole"", but he has came across as one to his wife's family"
33,2,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-23T00:37:18.119Z,Not everyone can pick up languages like he can.
33,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bbc,youngRhino,2020-04-23T00:37:30.922Z,The husband seems to be annoyed he has to translate. Should he just tell the mom to get someone else to do it sometimes or call less
33,2,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,snappyGorilla,2020-04-23T00:37:35.789Z,No he obviously has a knack for languages.
33,2,5ea0d59e9dc0406f8988a5f0,youngRabbit,2020-04-23T00:37:40.517Z,"I think it would be OK for husband to tell MIL ""don't call at work"" but telling her when and how to learn english is rude"
33,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763afc,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:37:47.245Z,It must be very frustrating to him that he feels he is only a translator
33,2,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-23T00:38:20.332Z,"I think he should be glad to have an ""in"" with the family as a translator. It's a good way to be liked an accepted."
33,2,5ea0d59e9dc0406f8988a5f0,youngRabbit,2020-04-23T00:38:20.655Z,"And maybe she just wants to talk to him, to make him part of her family. Would be nice to have a MIL that talks nicely in any way!"
33,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763afc,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:38:30.989Z,His in laws should be respectful and not bother him at work
33,2,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,snappyGorilla,2020-04-23T00:38:31.101Z,"I think he should help them, but if he is busy he does not have to answer the phone!"
33,2,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-23T00:38:32.979Z,I agree youngRabbit
33,2,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-23T00:38:56.684Z,Yes he can set a boundry about work for sure
33,2,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-23T00:39:03.324Z,boundary 
33,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bbc,youngRhino,2020-04-23T00:39:06.926Z,The family should not attack him or call him racist for trying to get the mother to learn the language that 99% of the country speaks
33,2,5ea0d59e9dc0406f8988a5f0,youngRabbit,2020-04-23T00:39:10.218Z,conventionalDonkey and snappyGorilla very smart and true!
33,2,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,snappyGorilla,2020-04-23T00:39:19.747Z,I also think that they all need to learn to be more considerate to one another.
33,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763afc,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:39:30.990Z,Maybe the husband could set a time to give his wife and her family english lessons 
33,2,5ea0d59e9dc0406f8988a5f0,youngRabbit,2020-04-23T00:39:44.209Z,"youngRhino right too, making this about racism hurts the family, they shouldn't turn on him"
33,2,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,snappyGorilla,2020-04-23T00:39:46.746Z,Yea good idea likelySquirrel
33,2,5ea0d59e9dc0406f8988a5f0,youngRabbit,2020-04-23T00:39:56.467Z,likelySquirrel Genius!
33,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763afc,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:40:11.936Z,I agree he should not be called a racist I don't think his frustration got anything to do with race
33,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763e52,culturedBear,2020-04-23T00:40:13.169Z,"looks like majority says he is an asshole, right?"
33,2,5ea0d59e9dc0406f8988a5f0,youngRabbit,2020-04-23T00:40:35.951Z,culturedBear right mostly NTA
33,2,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,snappyGorilla,2020-04-23T00:40:37.679Z,Yeah I have to say I think that he is 
33,2,5ea0d59e9dc0406f8988a5f0,youngRabbit,2020-04-23T00:40:55.806Z,"Sorry, I meant most yes, he IS TA"
33,2,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-23T00:41:03.583Z,"It's up to the MIL and her husband and their culture, etc. whether they want to learn English, but they don't need him tell them to do it"
33,2,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-23T00:41:29.872Z,"Yes, he is TA. Plus it's only temporary while his wife is in college"
33,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763e52,culturedBear,2020-04-23T00:41:46.211Z,he can be. haha. yes then
33,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bbc,youngRhino,2020-04-23T00:41:48.030Z,this is not the same story?
33,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bbc,youngRhino,2020-04-23T00:41:56.251Z,it does not say the wife is in college
33,2,5de2adbcb50e5a679ae8695b,snappyGorilla,2020-04-23T00:42:06.141Z,He should just not answer when he is to busy otherwise help those damn immigrants!
33,2,5ea0d1f29dc0406f89889eef,conventionalDonkey,2020-04-23T00:42:09.716Z,"oh lol, figured it was his side of same story "
33,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763e52,culturedBear,2020-04-23T00:42:12.381Z,verdict?
33,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763afc,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:42:24.710Z,The husband should not be judge to harshly this has been going on for 8 years maybe he is just not have the patience to teach I know I don't
33,2,5ea0d59e9dc0406f8988a5f0,youngRabbit,2020-04-23T00:42:42.730Z,The countries were different but it did sound like the same story
34,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763785,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:25:18.342Z,They really seemed like the asshole 
34,0,5d482ea721c9be351f76308e,spryHorse,2020-04-23T00:25:38.604Z,I think that the MIL should try to learn the language after 8 years of living here.
34,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:25:38.886Z,He is unkind and disrespectful. 
34,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764138,youngPanda,2020-04-23T00:26:10.315Z,"Not the asshole. OP could have definitely told their mother in law in a more gentle way, but OP is still right. Mother in law can't depend on everyone around her forever."
34,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763785,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:26:10.859Z,"it sounded like he was the person she called last, so it cant have really been that often too"
34,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:26:23.058Z,"If he does now want to translate for her, he should make himself unavailable but the way he tells the story shows that he does not want to help her."
34,0,5d482ea721c9be351f76308e,spryHorse,2020-04-23T00:26:32.743Z,I think he's frustrated and after 8 years.
34,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763456,youngBison,2020-04-23T00:26:34.578Z,"He is the asshole, don’t have to translate if you don’t want... but you don’t get to tell her what to learn"
34,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:27:24.601Z,I think he would be impatient helping her learn English and it would not work even if he wanted to do it. I just think he doesn't want to be bothered.
34,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763785,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:27:35.335Z,yeah
34,0,5d482ea721c9be351f76308e,spryHorse,2020-04-23T00:27:36.541Z,"It's for her own good, what if she has an emergency and can't communicate with medical personnel? Some hospitals have people that can translate, but some don't."
34,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:28:08.680Z,She should learn it but you can't make her.
34,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763899,newMonkey,2020-04-23T00:28:19.621Z,I do not think he is an asshole because he tried to help her with resources to help her learn English on her own in a very nice way. It can be very annoying to be randomly be receiving random phone calls to translate for the grandmother. 
34,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:28:20.563Z,It is her choice.
34,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764138,youngPanda,2020-04-23T00:28:56.558Z,"It's definitely not the best way to tell her about it, but his feelings are valid. Not everyone can cater to your language needs 24/7"
34,0,5d482ea721c9be351f76308e,spryHorse,2020-04-23T00:29:05.157Z,"It sounds like she has refused to learn at all. I'm sure he was really frustrated and lost his temper with her, which he shouldn't have done. He should have had a discussion with the family."
34,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:29:11.199Z,He comes across as annoyed but it is not his responsibility to teach her.
34,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:29:33.982Z,"Yes, the family should help as a group."
34,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764138,youngPanda,2020-04-23T00:29:52.455Z,"If she really wants a constant translator around, she could hire one. Otherwise, don't expect much help from family, especially when it bothers them often"
34,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763785,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T00:29:53.070Z,I'd be interested to know why the whole family thinks he's an asshole if he really was just sort of rude in saying no
34,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,smallRhino,2020-04-23T00:30:00.723Z,Her daughter might be the key person to help out. Could be an in-law issue.
34,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763456,youngBison,2020-04-23T00:30:06.015Z,It is her choice to learn it or not.  Like it is his to translate or not.  He would not be an asshole for making the choice to not translate.  It seems as if he came off like her was trying to tell her she had to learn it.
34,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763899,newMonkey,2020-04-23T00:31:11.233Z,Exactly it sounds like she just wants to be lazy and not put in the effort to learn because she has these people to help her always. Although it is harder to learn a language the older you get and idk just how old the mother is
34,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763456,culturedHorse,2020-04-23T00:40:22.206Z,She shouldn’t assume it is up to her to decide what her husband does with his time.  She is the asshole
34,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764138,smallSquirrel,2020-04-23T00:40:28.338Z,She's the asshole. Your husband's feelings are just as valid as your parents.
34,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76308e,culturedPanda,2020-04-23T00:40:29.616Z,"I feel that she may be the asshole here. Everyone is busy, but it sounds like the translation burden has been increasing for her husband."
34,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,newBison,2020-04-23T00:40:36.354Z,There is a fundamental clash of cultures here. He does not respect her culture and she has expectations for him based on her culture that may be unfair to him.
34,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763785,culturedHippo,2020-04-23T00:40:47.565Z,I agree with that
34,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764138,smallSquirrel,2020-04-23T00:40:50.071Z,Same
34,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763785,culturedHippo,2020-04-23T00:41:03.361Z,"Although I can't decide if theyre both the asshole, or neither is the asshole"
34,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,newBison,2020-04-23T00:41:19.966Z,Both are. This marriage is in trouble.
34,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76308e,culturedPanda,2020-04-23T00:41:22.206Z,"It has to be difficult, because he's not just translating but also having to explain the material to them. That could really wear on you after awhile, especially for years."
34,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763899,niceGoat,2020-04-23T00:41:30.987Z,I think she is kind of an asshole if she expects him to do it all the time. He should be expected to help out sometimes if its not consistent but like another person said here she should not decide what her husband should do with his time.
34,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,newBison,2020-04-23T00:41:34.719Z,He married into this.
34,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763456,culturedHorse,2020-04-23T00:41:37.143Z,"Well, this sounds like unanimous assholes based on forced translation expectations."
34,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763899,niceGoat,2020-04-23T00:41:51.108Z,Plus it sounds like she has siblings since she is the oldest why dont they help?
34,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763456,culturedHorse,2020-04-23T00:42:07.099Z,"Unless, there was a prenup on translations while working full time and in school."
34,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,newBison,2020-04-23T00:42:09.835Z,Yes! Her family should help more.
34,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76308e,culturedPanda,2020-04-23T00:42:20.590Z,"They need to come together as a family and decide how best to handle the language gap. If I moved to another country, I would learn the language so that I could function and get around."
34,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763785,culturedHippo,2020-04-23T00:42:21.766Z,Her last couple lines also made it sound like she really doesn't respect his time.
34,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,newBison,2020-04-23T00:42:41.133Z,"This issue will not be all they face. For example, which language with their children speak? They need counseling."
34,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76308e,culturedPanda,2020-04-23T00:43:09.912Z,I would be constantly worried about my parents if they couldn't speak the language. What if an emergency happens?
34,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,newBison,2020-04-23T00:43:14.088Z,She doesn't and is ugly about his views. Disrespect all around.
34,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764138,smallSquirrel,2020-04-23T00:43:18.379Z,"It's reasonable to want your parents to get help for whatever they have trouble with, however it is not reasonable to hurt others by expecting them to do things they don't want to do."
34,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,newBison,2020-04-23T00:43:54.827Z,They both need attitude adjustments.
34,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76308e,culturedPanda,2020-04-23T00:44:03.216Z,I think I would loose my temper about this if I was the husband. I can see why he became upset.
34,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763456,culturedHorse,2020-04-23T00:44:07.174Z,And google translate 
34,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,newBison,2020-04-23T00:44:08.951Z,There are bigger issues than just this.
34,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d5d,newBison,2020-04-23T00:44:44.068Z,So do we all agree? Both assholes?
34,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763785,culturedHippo,2020-04-23T00:44:44.431Z,"Yeah, they don't seem to be communicating effectively about it with each other"
34,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763785,culturedHippo,2020-04-23T00:44:48.014Z,Yeah
34,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76308e,culturedPanda,2020-04-23T00:45:00.941Z,It sounds like they have some fractures in their marriage and this is the straw that broke the camel's back.
34,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763456,culturedHorse,2020-04-23T00:45:04.487Z,I agree on her being asshole.
34,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764138,smallSquirrel,2020-04-23T00:45:10.948Z,"They either make a compromise or the marriage is in trouble, disagreements happen but if no one is willing to compromise then problems only grow as the marriage goes on."
34,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763785,culturedHippo,2020-04-23T00:45:12.083Z,"I assume we can only say if the OP is an asshole or not, so I think all we can say is yes"
34,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76308e,culturedPanda,2020-04-23T00:45:49.537Z,I do believe that she is the asshole in this situation. They all need to come together and figure this out.
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a5f,snappyRhino,2020-04-23T14:48:46.148Z,"He is not being an Ass, But he handled it wrong. "
35,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636fb,smallLion,2020-04-23T14:48:56.654Z,"At first I was like wtf man but then reading that he spoke to her respectfully about it, I think he wasn’t an asshole"
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b6e,youngPanda,2020-04-23T14:49:13.445Z,I agree 
35,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76310c,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T14:49:16.534Z,I agree. Until the edit part I did think he was being an asshole but he sounded like he at least tried to be nice
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b6e,youngPanda,2020-04-23T14:49:23.677Z,you 
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763af0,niceDonkey,2020-04-23T14:49:25.751Z,"Yeah, first impressions, even by his own words, he was being an ass, but then clarified that he was trying to be respectful about it."
35,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636fb,smallLion,2020-04-23T14:49:28.397Z,I think he’s looking out for her and trying to make life easier for her
35,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76310c,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T14:49:44.930Z,It is hard situation as I do feel for her mother in law
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a5f,snappyRhino,2020-04-23T14:49:46.699Z,He should have asked politetly for her to not call him during certain times that can be disruptive and then offered to help her learn English
35,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76310c,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T14:49:56.040Z,Maybe she has a really hard time learning a new language
35,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76310c,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T14:50:19.428Z,Yes maybe he could have put some boundaries on it
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763af0,niceDonkey,2020-04-23T14:50:26.451Z,"yeah, he didn't handle it well. And if its not a good time for him to be her translator, he shouldn't pick up the phone, or should and politely state that now is not a good time and to contact someone else"
35,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636fb,smallLion,2020-04-23T14:50:27.311Z,"English is a hard language to learn, but even learning the basics so she can go the store/ect would be helpful and I think that’s what he was trying to tel her"
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a5f,snappyRhino,2020-04-23T14:50:38.344Z,I live In So Cal so this stuff happens all the time here. But really its all about how you approach it
35,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76310c,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T14:51:03.790Z,Yes hopefully in the long run his conversation is helping her get up the confidence to learn English
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a5f,snappyRhino,2020-04-23T14:51:12.789Z,But you dont want to ignore a call and have it be an emergancy.. its kind of a catch 22
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b6e,youngPanda,2020-04-23T14:51:34.566Z,"he gave her alot of re sorceress to learn and yes boundaries are needed, but she needs co consider that he has a life too and cant drop everything to translate"
35,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636fb,smallLion,2020-04-23T14:51:40.004Z,I can understand his frustrations though. 
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763af0,niceDonkey,2020-04-23T14:51:41.867Z,yeah. And it did sound like he was willing to help her learn. He just came across at first as being a jerk about it.
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a5f,snappyRhino,2020-04-23T14:52:04.556Z,The Family needs to help her learn English and be supportive so she can be more independant. He is just the only one willing to say it out loud
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b6e,youngPanda,2020-04-23T14:52:30.800Z,I think maybe he could try and teach her basics especially in case of an emergency 
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763af0,niceDonkey,2020-04-23T14:52:37.128Z,"And she may just feel more comfortable with him, which is why she contacts him more so than anyone else"
35,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636fb,smallLion,2020-04-23T14:52:40.936Z,"His first way of saying it was terrible. But if he gave her resources and info and offered help, I truly think he’s looking out for her best interested"
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763af0,niceDonkey,2020-04-23T14:53:17.946Z,"I agree, "
35,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76310c,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T14:53:24.234Z,Me too
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a5f,snappyRhino,2020-04-23T14:53:27.416Z,His Wife needs to help too. She should be more willing to teach her mother too for safety reasons
35,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76310c,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T14:53:33.383Z,I think we all agree he wasnt being an asshole over all
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b6e,youngPanda,2020-04-23T14:53:38.703Z,yes
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763af0,niceDonkey,2020-04-23T14:53:39.774Z,"yeah, "
35,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636fb,smallLion,2020-04-23T14:53:40.106Z,Exactly
35,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a5f,snappyRhino,2020-04-23T14:53:42.204Z,yep agreed
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a5f,smallGiraffe,2020-04-23T15:03:44.785Z,Yep She is an Asshole. She might try to write it prettier but yep its her.
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763af0,likelyPig,2020-04-23T15:04:07.309Z,"So I get that she's busy, but she shouldn't expect him to drop everything to do favors for her mom. She should ask him if its a good time for him to help out, and be accepting of his answers."
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a5f,smallGiraffe,2020-04-23T15:04:10.363Z,Sorry but if she is going for her MASTERS then she knows tht learning a new language is doable
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b6e,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T15:04:18.769Z,"Okay first of all I don't think the poster is the ass for trying to help her mother, but she kind of is for putting it on her husband"
35,2,5d482ea821c9be351f76310c,niceLion,2020-04-23T15:04:20.235Z,The line about helping mom only 10 minutes every once in awhile really got me. If that is all it is why can't she help too?
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763af0,likelyPig,2020-04-23T15:04:46.786Z,"Very true, 10 minutes once in awhile is nothing, if she wants to be helping her family. "
35,2,5d482ea821c9be351f76310c,niceLion,2020-04-23T15:04:47.814Z,Yes I think the fact that she is making her husband do it all the time makes her an asshole
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a5f,smallGiraffe,2020-04-23T15:04:55.522Z,And its her parents not his. She has passed them off so often that they are leaving her out of the loop. That tells you that they thing she is an ass too.
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763af0,likelyPig,2020-04-23T15:05:10.154Z,She's not taking into account his time and priorities.
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763af0,likelyPig,2020-04-23T15:05:32.843Z,"Very good point, they are bypassing her for a reason"
35,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7636fb,spryMonkey,2020-04-23T15:05:33.301Z,She states her husband should make time but also states she’s too busy so she passes it off. Like what?!
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a5f,smallGiraffe,2020-04-23T15:05:50.648Z,And that privelege remark. Sorry honey but there are community classes taht teach englisha nd they are affordable
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b6e,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T15:06:04.448Z,"I think its the mother in laws fault, if i lived somewhere for a long time and constantly needed help i would be asking my family to help me learn so i don't have to bother them as much"
35,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7636fb,spryMonkey,2020-04-23T15:06:17.151Z,What would she do if her husband didn’t learn Spanish? 
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763af0,likelyPig,2020-04-23T15:06:17.772Z,Some classes are free in fact.
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763af0,likelyPig,2020-04-23T15:06:37.589Z,"And by helping out all the time, they are also enabling the mother."
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a5f,smallGiraffe,2020-04-23T15:06:49.391Z,But the kids are enabling her and then putting all on the Gringo to help them as if its his responsibility
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b6e,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T15:07:06.791Z,I understand to her its normal to her at the same time because she has been doing it all of her life
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a5f,smallGiraffe,2020-04-23T15:07:20.562Z,her nicely worded way of telling us seems way moore offensive than his did.
35,2,5d482ea821c9be351f76310c,niceLion,2020-04-23T15:07:23.596Z,I see your points about enabling but I think ultimately in this situation the daughter is being an asshole
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b6e,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T15:07:24.761Z,"so i don't blame the wife, i blame her mom"
35,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7636fb,spryMonkey,2020-04-23T15:07:25.824Z,I think the fact her husband has even been helping while she’s ‘too busy’ makes her an ass
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763af0,likelyPig,2020-04-23T15:07:44.889Z,"Yeah, culturally, but as she points out, there are benefits to learning otehr cultures as welll, and it doesn't sound like she is taking into account, her husband's culture."
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a5f,smallGiraffe,2020-04-23T15:07:52.045Z,yep I think we agree she is an ass
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763af0,likelyPig,2020-04-23T15:07:56.978Z,yep
35,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7636fb,spryMonkey,2020-04-23T15:08:01.663Z,Defintly
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b6e,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T15:08:03.180Z,i don't agree
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763af0,likelyPig,2020-04-23T15:08:13.081Z,"I can kinda see both sides, here, but she's being an ass"
35,2,5d482ea821c9be351f76310c,niceLion,2020-04-23T15:08:30.116Z,I also think shs is 
35,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7636fb,spryMonkey,2020-04-23T15:08:39.727Z,The fact she expects of her husband what she doesn’t want to do makes her an asshole to me
35,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763af0,likelyPig,2020-04-23T15:09:08.300Z,"It seems as if instead of taking turns, she's pawnign it all off on him."
35,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7636fb,spryMonkey,2020-04-23T15:09:27.294Z,Exactly my thoughts too
36,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da2,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-23T14:45:35.763Z,"I think this guy is very rude, this is his mom's house not a german hostel."
36,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763435,snappyWolf,2020-04-23T14:45:41.847Z,I think he should have been more repectful to his mother.  
36,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,snappyRabbit,2020-04-23T14:45:45.238Z,"Well, I think that he should have been speaking English. After all, his mother doesn't know German at all. "
36,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,snappyRabbit,2020-04-23T14:45:54.968Z,And at least his husband knows *some* English.
36,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762fb3,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T14:46:04.588Z,I think he should have translated for his Mom what they were discussing 
36,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762fc7,culturedDonkey,2020-04-23T14:46:15.256Z,So I can see both sides of the story however the wife and her husband are the asshole. He should have sucked it up and spoke english. who cares if he is embarrased. They are in her moms house 
36,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,snappyRabbit,2020-04-23T14:46:16.818Z,"Yes! That, if nothing else, would be polite."
36,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76322c,spryPanda,2020-04-23T14:46:18.391Z,He should see this as an opportunity for his husband to learn more English and be kind to his mother.
36,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,snappyRabbit,2020-04-23T14:46:27.830Z,"That's a good point, too."
36,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da2,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-23T14:46:30.340Z,"I think it is quite selfish of his husband, he obviously had no interest in getting to know this woman."
36,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763435,snappyWolf,2020-04-23T14:46:31.092Z,It shouldn't matter if his husmband is uncomfortable speaking english.  I think the mother would have understood that he is from a foreign country and couldnt speak english very well.
36,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76322c,spryPanda,2020-04-23T14:46:48.804Z,He should include his mother n the conversations and translate back and forth.
36,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,snappyRabbit,2020-04-23T14:46:55.228Z,I think she would have appreciated at least the effort to speak English.
36,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76322c,spryPanda,2020-04-23T14:47:01.618Z,agreed
36,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762fc7,culturedDonkey,2020-04-23T14:47:03.109Z,I agree
36,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762fb3,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T14:47:05.022Z,Yes he should have made an effort
36,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da2,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-23T14:47:31.432Z,"It looks like the consensus is that this guy is the asshole, I see no scenario where this would be acceptable."
36,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762fb3,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T14:47:39.917Z,agreed

36,0,5ea13020de5d74641b66be9e,snappyRhino,2020-04-23T14:47:54.545Z,hes thge ass
36,0,5ea13020de5d74641b66be9e,snappyRhino,2020-04-23T14:48:04.416Z,the*
36,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76322c,spryPanda,2020-04-23T14:48:46.510Z,We did consider both sides and have agreed that he is an asshole.
36,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,snappyRabbit,2020-04-23T14:48:56.558Z,Yes.
36,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da2,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-23T14:49:01.828Z,I've tried to consider both sides but these two are so rude.
36,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763435,snappyWolf,2020-04-23T14:49:09.356Z,"I did consider his feeelings about not wanting to make the husband uncomfortable and if that was the case he should have, as others stated, translated for hit mother."
36,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,snappyRabbit,2020-04-23T14:49:27.876Z,"I remember being stuck in a group of French exchange students. Very awkward not knowing French, so I feel they should have, at least, translated."
36,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da2,conventionalGiraffe,2020-04-23T14:49:55.873Z,I also have been around french people who refused to speak english.  Most germans I have met speak it quite well.
36,0,5ea13020de5d74641b66be9e,snappyRhino,2020-04-23T14:50:13.695Z,"i feel like both sides can be arses. The inlaws for not making the guest feel welcomed, and the guy for being  disrespectful. but in the end, dude is thee arse!"
36,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762fc7,culturedDonkey,2020-04-23T14:50:37.684Z,He should have at least made the effort- im sure the mom wouldnt have jugded the english 
36,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,snappyRabbit,2020-04-23T14:51:10.528Z,We all seem to agree that the couple was in the wrong and very rude.
36,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762fb3,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T14:51:10.999Z,I think the fellow is an asshole becuase he didn't include his Mother in his converstations with his husband.  He could have trasnlatedfor his Mother to understand . e that would have helped his husband to learn more English.  
36,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76322c,spryPanda,2020-04-23T14:51:42.489Z,I just voted
36,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762fb3,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-23T15:30:13.829Z,I don't think the mother was an asshole.  
36,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,youngCow,2020-04-23T15:30:15.777Z,"Hi Everyone. I think that the dominant language should be spoken. In other words, the language spoken by the most people."
36,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763435,snappyGoat,2020-04-23T15:30:19.144Z,I dont think that its unreasonable for the person to want the guests to speak english in their house.
36,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da2,culturedRabbit,2020-04-23T15:30:21.716Z,"It's the woman's home, not an airbnb for french tourists.  If you can speak english, don't be so rude."
36,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,youngCow,2020-04-23T15:30:27.733Z,I think they should have translated or just spoken French privately
36,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76322c,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T15:30:30.790Z,SHe was justified in asking the men to speak in english or at least translate in order to include her.
36,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,youngCow,2020-04-23T15:30:39.855Z,"And yes, spoken English because she is the host."
36,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762fc7,nicePig,2020-04-23T15:30:46.782Z,I agree- it is not unreasonable for everyone to speak english especially since the boyfriend can speaak english
36,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762fb3,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-23T15:30:52.933Z,I think that he should have spoken English so she could understand and translated anything his partner didn't understand. 
36,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,youngCow,2020-04-23T15:30:54.577Z,I agree.
36,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763435,snappyGoat,2020-04-23T15:30:59.488Z,The husband can speak english and chose not to.  That is disrespectful.
36,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76322c,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T15:31:05.531Z,I agree.
36,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,youngCow,2020-04-23T15:31:23.041Z,"If they were further away, I would understand if they didn't consider her as part of the same conversational space, but it seems they were pretty close in proximity."
36,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762fc7,nicePig,2020-04-23T15:31:27.909Z,Agreed- very disrespectful at least speak english when the mom is around 
36,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763da2,culturedRabbit,2020-04-23T15:31:34.621Z,"I think it would be equally rude if she was visiting their place and they sat there and spoke French, why even visit if you're not going to talk?"
36,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76322c,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T15:31:56.169Z,It could be a learning experience for all of them.  She could learn a little French and the husband could refine his English
36,3,5d482ea821c9be351f76322c,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T15:32:24.365Z,I agree with culturedRabbit 
36,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,youngCow,2020-04-23T15:32:28.417Z,"Just to play the opposite side...perhaps they have closer talking distances than in the U.S., so they felt she was out of the ""zone"" of who was within range."
36,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763435,snappyGoat,2020-04-23T15:32:31.690Z,I could agree with that point.  But if you are going to visit a foreign country you should at least try to learn the language before you go.  This guy on the other hand already knew how to speak english.
36,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,youngCow,2020-04-23T15:32:32.885Z,But I don't really agree with that.
36,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762fb3,conventionalMonkey,2020-04-23T15:32:37.131Z,I like that idea conventionalSquirrel a learning experience for the partner and the Mom. 
36,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,youngCow,2020-04-23T15:32:45.698Z,I also agree. Good experiences for both
36,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,youngCow,2020-04-23T15:33:12.319Z,It seems pretty unanimous. 
36,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,youngCow,2020-04-23T15:34:14.447Z,I think it was also rude of the husband to leave shortly afterwards.
36,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763435,snappyGoat,2020-04-23T15:34:22.101Z,I agree.
36,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763435,snappyGoat,2020-04-23T15:35:07.359Z,If they wanted to bridge the gap they could have just spoke english as everyone knew how to.  But instead the son decided it was best to try to make the mother feel uncomfortable.
36,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762dbf,youngCow,2020-04-23T15:35:17.348Z,"Seems like it, yes."
37,1,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,smallHorse,2020-04-23T15:22:55.310Z,My initial impression of the user is that he wantes to please both mom and husband
37,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762e2b,likelyDonkey,2020-04-23T15:22:56.852Z,"I think the first thing I considered was that they are only in US part time, so that is impacting the mother's response"
37,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762e2b,likelyDonkey,2020-04-23T15:23:11.231Z,yes!  he does want both to be happy
37,1,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,smallHorse,2020-04-23T15:23:24.784Z,"I thought so, too. The user wants to make sure they are both happy."
37,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76309e,likelyGorilla,2020-04-23T15:23:30.004Z,I don't see why they can't speak to their mom in English to catch her up on their life. 
37,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762d69,smallGoat,2020-04-23T15:23:36.021Z,She make the very right decision 
37,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762e2b,likelyDonkey,2020-04-23T15:23:36.954Z,But I think hearing more English would help the husband
37,1,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,smallHorse,2020-04-23T15:23:44.892Z,He is also considering how uncomfortable English makes the husband. 
37,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763232,niceOrangutan,2020-04-23T15:23:45.735Z,"I believe he wants to please both sides, but he shouldn't allow his significant other to make him choose"
37,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76309e,likelyGorilla,2020-04-23T15:23:54.487Z,The husband will only get more comfortable with English if he actually tries to apply himself and use it.
37,1,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,smallHorse,2020-04-23T15:23:55.393Z,"I thought the same things, why can't he fill the mom in in English!"
37,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762e2b,likelyDonkey,2020-04-23T15:24:10.439Z,"yes, the husband said speaking is hard,but I know sometimes hearing another language isn't as hard"
37,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762d69,smallGoat,2020-04-23T15:24:16.549Z,Though her husband too should learn more English 
37,1,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,smallHorse,2020-04-23T15:24:18.016Z,I can agree with that. 
37,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762e2b,likelyDonkey,2020-04-23T15:24:44.536Z,"It would be different if the husband spoke no English, but that's not the case"
37,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763232,niceOrangutan,2020-04-23T15:24:45.224Z,He should be able to speak German and translate and English at the same time; and the husband should learn to at least speak English. 
37,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76309e,likelyGorilla,2020-04-23T15:24:45.693Z,"Yeah, he will still know what they are saying. He can respond in German and the daughter can translate it."
37,1,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,smallHorse,2020-04-23T15:24:56.172Z,Maybe hearing the language could help the husband in areas he is uncomfortable.
37,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762e2b,likelyDonkey,2020-04-23T15:25:29.877Z,They are staying at the mother's house -- it's wrong to exclude her while they are her guests!
37,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76309e,likelyGorilla,2020-04-23T15:25:34.318Z,I think they are just being inconsiderate to the mom which honestly makes me think they are the asshole.
37,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762d69,smallGoat,2020-04-23T15:25:43.790Z,"Translating might not be too easy, depending on the conversation thogh "
37,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763232,niceOrangutan,2020-04-23T15:25:45.458Z,I agree 
37,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763232,niceOrangutan,2020-04-23T15:26:29.028Z,But at the same time it's not easy for the mother to figure what is being said as well
37,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762e2b,likelyDonkey,2020-04-23T15:26:38.028Z,I think they need to be more considerate of the mother.
37,1,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,smallHorse,2020-04-23T15:26:48.971Z,"I can see how this is a difficult situation for the husband, but I'm wondering if there could be a compromise for both the mother and the husband. "
37,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762d69,smallGoat,2020-04-23T15:27:16.946Z,"Both side should try to adjust, the mother should be more understanding and the the husband should learn more English "
37,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762e2b,likelyDonkey,2020-04-23T15:27:24.522Z,"yes, maybe some time spent in English"
37,1,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,smallHorse,2020-04-23T15:27:26.173Z,I agree with that!
37,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763232,niceOrangutan,2020-04-23T15:27:34.055Z,I agree as well
37,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76309e,likelyGorilla,2020-04-23T15:27:36.114Z,I can't wrap my head around not filling his mom in on what's going on in English. Why would you be that difficult? 
37,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762d69,smallGoat,2020-04-23T15:27:39.411Z,Right
37,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763232,niceOrangutan,2020-04-23T15:27:57.646Z,I don't understand why that would be difficult as well
37,1,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,smallHorse,2020-04-23T15:28:17.600Z,I don't either!
37,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762d69,smallGoat,2020-04-23T15:28:32.059Z,She is not
37,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76309e,likelyGorilla,2020-04-23T15:28:32.636Z,"The son is making things more difficult than they have to do and frankly I think he's being disrespectful to his mom. So yeah, he's the asshole."
37,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763232,niceOrangutan,2020-04-23T15:29:07.604Z,Yes he's an asshole for not including the mother
37,2,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,newHorse,2020-04-23T15:37:36.291Z,I think the mother was justified in saying they should speak english.
37,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763232,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T15:37:40.073Z,I am not really sure if this person is an asshole or not 
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762d69,youngPig,2020-04-23T15:37:49.485Z,I thin the mother has point 
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762e2b,conventionalWolf,2020-04-23T15:37:51.964Z,"I agree, they were being rude"
37,2,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,newHorse,2020-04-23T15:38:07.315Z,I don't think the mom is. They should know that they could be uncomfortable.
37,2,5d482ea821c9be351f76309e,littleBear,2020-04-23T15:38:19.317Z,I lean towards not an asshole because the person speaks English but just has an accent. There's no reason they can't speak English around the mom.
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762d69,youngPig,2020-04-23T15:38:24.645Z,"Yes, they were rude, making her not comfortable"
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762e2b,conventionalWolf,2020-04-23T15:38:35.349Z,To expect her to sit there and be excluded was not very caring of the son. 
37,2,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,newHorse,2020-04-23T15:38:37.812Z,"I agree with that! If the person couldn't speak english, it would be different."
37,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763232,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T15:38:38.208Z,I don't understand why they can't speak both English and French
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762e2b,conventionalWolf,2020-04-23T15:38:52.572Z,"Exactly, the SIL can speak English.  Why wouldn't they?  "
37,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763232,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T15:39:07.562Z,Both the person can speak English
37,2,5d482ea821c9be351f76309e,littleBear,2020-04-23T15:39:11.104Z,Yeah if the SO wants to speak French the son could translate for the mom.
37,2,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,newHorse,2020-04-23T15:39:24.551Z,"Right, if they wanted to talk about something private, they should go away from the mom."
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762d69,youngPig,2020-04-23T15:39:32.712Z,Yes she is not TAH
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762d69,youngPig,2020-04-23T15:39:45.711Z,That is right.
37,2,5d482ea821c9be351f76309e,littleBear,2020-04-23T15:40:09.065Z,I agree 
37,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763232,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T15:40:10.922Z,It would be rude if the man couldn't speak English at all
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762e2b,conventionalWolf,2020-04-23T15:40:13.261Z,I can't think of any arguments to support the son in not using English
37,2,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,newHorse,2020-04-23T15:40:26.278Z,"I can't either, He should use it around his mom"
37,2,5d482ea821c9be351f76309e,littleBear,2020-04-23T15:40:53.860Z,I guess if he cares more about the comfort of one over the other. But that is definitely asshole behavior.
37,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763232,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T15:41:09.265Z,"But to accommodate the mother they should speak English, knowing that the mother does not speak French."
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762e2b,conventionalWolf,2020-04-23T15:41:26.434Z,"Occasionally using French would be fine, but when she joins them, it would make sense to switch to English. "
37,2,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,newHorse,2020-04-23T15:41:27.044Z,I can see how the mom wants to be included and I can also see how they may want to talk more privately. But that should be done away from the mother.
37,2,5d482ea821c9be351f76309e,littleBear,2020-04-23T15:41:29.592Z,I'm saying the son's behavior is asshole-ish not the mom.
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762d69,youngPig,2020-04-23T15:41:39.500Z,Neither can I defend the son's behavior too
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762e2b,conventionalWolf,2020-04-23T15:41:40.192Z,"yes, the son is TA"
37,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763232,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T15:42:03.360Z,So I believe the mother is not an asshole 
37,2,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,newHorse,2020-04-23T15:42:09.498Z,me too
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762e2b,conventionalWolf,2020-04-23T15:42:11.657Z,The mother is not
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762d69,youngPig,2020-04-23T15:42:20.563Z,Yes the son is TAH
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762e2b,conventionalWolf,2020-04-23T15:42:50.493Z,I think the fact that she is hosting them for a week shows that she is welcoming to the SO
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762d69,youngPig,2020-04-23T15:42:50.702Z,The question is about the mother been the HA
37,2,5ea1a6e0de5d74641b66d1d6,newHorse,2020-04-23T15:43:09.105Z,The person is not an asshole.
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762d69,youngPig,2020-04-23T15:43:24.062Z,Yes 
37,2,5d482ea821c9be351f76309e,littleBear,2020-04-23T15:43:27.430Z,Mom is not the asshole.
37,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763232,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T15:43:32.620Z,"Yes, the mother is not an asshole"
37,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762d69,youngPig,2020-04-23T15:43:53.541Z,Mom is not the asshole.
38,0,5e9f0aa29dc0406f8987499b,likelyGiraffe,2020-04-23T16:22:00.960Z,"We're currently staying at my mother's house for the weekend, and she's been gracious enough to host us and provide us meals. It's been nice seeing family again."
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dea,spryHorse,2020-04-23T16:22:15.175Z,She should hve spoken to her family in english because she was at their house. She could have interpreted for her husband.
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762e52,likelyRhino,2020-04-23T16:22:21.717Z,"She should consider the fact that her mother is being generous and letting her and her husband stay at her home and feeding them. Her mom only has a simple wish which is to feel included, so she should just do that. "
38,0,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225d,littleWolf,2020-04-23T16:22:23.629Z,"Some rounds will be done in a GROUP, and others will be done BY YOURSELF."
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762d81,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T16:22:34.680Z,Do you think he is an asshole for speaking German?
38,0,5e9f0aa29dc0406f8987499b,likelyGiraffe,2020-04-23T16:22:36.847Z,he says he hates that he sometimes doesn't know the right words. And for me in particular he just prefers German. So we almost always speak German to each other.
38,0,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225d,littleWolf,2020-04-23T16:22:49.410Z,This now poses a dilemma for me becuase we're now at my mother's house. 
38,0,5ea0ded69dc0406f8988c09b,snappyGoat,2020-04-23T16:22:51.347Z,The person speaks English and German. The husband speaks English though not perfectly. The mother only speaks English. The Author could speak all English or both languages.
38,0,5e9f0aa29dc0406f8987499b,likelyGiraffe,2020-04-23T16:23:00.738Z,yes
38,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a08,newBear,2020-04-23T16:23:02.677Z,although it is time comsuming to translate she should be taking the time to translate for her mother or spend private time with mom while speaking in english
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dea,spryHorse,2020-04-23T16:23:05.462Z,I do think he was being harsh to her parnets by not trying to speak the only language they could understand.
38,0,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225d,littleWolf,2020-04-23T16:23:14.950Z,ofcourse
38,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a08,newBear,2020-04-23T16:23:35.045Z,there are also very simple apps that can be useed by all parties 
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762e52,likelyRhino,2020-04-23T16:23:35.467Z,"It seems that English is somewhat of a ""universal language"" compared to German, so I think her husband would understand the English. He also did mention that he has difficulty with speaking or knowing some words."
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762d81,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T16:23:47.891Z,"I think he needs to do a little of both, since his husband understands English"
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dea,spryHorse,2020-04-23T16:23:50.386Z,He was being disrespectful to her parents and she was accomidating that behavior. Disrespectful.
38,0,5ea1ab72de5d74641b66d75b,conventionalHippo,2020-04-23T16:23:56.989Z,My impression is that this guy is not the asshole. He is a grown man and married. They have made decisions within their marriage about the language they wish to use.
38,0,5ea1b66cde5d74641b66face,spryRabbit,2020-04-23T16:24:00.156Z,The husband doesn't feel comfortable speaking English. This obviously isn't the first time the mother has met him and probably knows this if she has spoken to him before. 
38,0,5e9f0aa29dc0406f8987499b,likelyGiraffe,2020-04-23T16:24:10.388Z,"My mom says I'm the asshole for not including her, that it's disrepectful and she wants to be caught up to my life after I been away for so long. I think the language I speak is my own choice"
38,0,5ea1b66cde5d74641b66face,spryRabbit,2020-04-23T16:24:12.918Z,"However, not knowing what is being spoken in your own house could be quite jarring,"
38,0,5ea1ab72de5d74641b66d75b,conventionalHippo,2020-04-23T16:24:32.055Z,Is he not allowed to speak english to his mom?
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dea,spryHorse,2020-04-23T16:24:35.051Z,Yet the mother only understood english. The daughter should have shown her some deference.
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762e52,likelyRhino,2020-04-23T16:24:35.948Z,That's a good point but I think the mom just wants to feel included and also might feel like she was being talked about in another language which makes her uncomfortable.
38,0,5e9f0aa29dc0406f8987499b,likelyGiraffe,2020-04-23T16:24:36.447Z,Though my husband speaks English he can be shy about it-
38,0,5ea1ab72de5d74641b66d75b,conventionalHippo,2020-04-23T16:24:44.059Z,Because if he is then none of this even matters
38,0,5ea0ded69dc0406f8988c09b,snappyGoat,2020-04-23T16:24:48.714Z,"I think she is an asshole. Rude to her mom, and the husband soes speak English, just not well."
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762d81,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T16:24:54.609Z,"I think it's disrespectful, to an extent. In other words, he needs to find common grounds."
38,0,5e9f0aa29dc0406f8987499b,likelyGiraffe,2020-04-23T16:25:03.237Z,It means I have to choose between including my mother in the conversation or making my husband comfortable. 
38,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a08,newBear,2020-04-23T16:25:10.573Z,Asshole is a bit harsh - maybe inconsiderate. 
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762e52,likelyRhino,2020-04-23T16:25:12.155Z,"I wonder why she even has to choose sides, just speak English with her mom when she is around and go back to speaking German when her mom isn't around."
38,0,5ea0ded69dc0406f8988c09b,snappyGoat,2020-04-23T16:25:13.945Z,You could do both things
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dea,spryHorse,2020-04-23T16:25:29.559Z,"Considering both sides, the parents could make an effort to learn German, but that puts them in the same boat as the husband who has learned English as a 2nd language. Doesn't it?"
38,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a08,newBear,2020-04-23T16:25:32.689Z,likelyRhino - I agree
38,0,5ea1b66cde5d74641b66face,spryRabbit,2020-04-23T16:25:35.053Z,"Common ground: just tell the mother he's not comfortable and ask if it's ok to speak German to him, be a translator and maybe when he is comfortable he will try to open up more."
38,0,5e9f0aa29dc0406f8987499b,likelyGiraffe,2020-04-23T16:25:40.173Z,we're now at my mother's house
38,0,5ea1ab72de5d74641b66d75b,conventionalHippo,2020-04-23T16:25:46.911Z,I think he has the right to choose the language that best suits his adult relationship. She needs to accept that and he can translate later
38,0,5e9f0aa29dc0406f8987499b,likelyGiraffe,2020-04-23T16:25:58.843Z,really
38,0,5ea0ded69dc0406f8988c09b,snappyGoat,2020-04-23T16:26:04.647Z,It can be translated immediately.
38,0,5e9f0aa29dc0406f8987499b,likelyGiraffe,2020-04-23T16:26:21.192Z,really
38,0,5ea1ab72de5d74641b66d75b,conventionalHippo,2020-04-23T16:26:21.201Z,yes. It can be translated immediately 
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762e52,likelyRhino,2020-04-23T16:26:27.629Z,They should just sit together and hash it out or just rent an apartment temporarily to avoid all this tension.
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762d81,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T16:26:36.915Z,"I think he can doa  mix of both, ask the mom a question and if the husband is there, say something to him in German... Back to the mother, and so on"
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dea,spryHorse,2020-04-23T16:26:37.599Z,The daughter is the key to this whole thing though. She is fluent in both languages. She and her husband really should accomodate their hosts - the parents.
38,0,5ea0ded69dc0406f8988c09b,snappyGoat,2020-04-23T16:26:39.303Z,"I think this is very rude to the mother, and unfair."
38,0,5ea1ab72de5d74641b66d75b,conventionalHippo,2020-04-23T16:27:06.646Z,I think hashing it out is the best. Find the root of the problems and try and find realistic solutions. 
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762e52,likelyRhino,2020-04-23T16:27:10.975Z,"Yes, the daughter is an asshole for being disrespectful to her mom where she is staying at."
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762d81,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T16:27:25.842Z,So I think the person is an asshole for choosing one side over the other in this circumnstance.
38,0,5ea0ded69dc0406f8988c09b,snappyGoat,2020-04-23T16:27:51.655Z,"Yes, the daughter is an asshole. She can speak both languages, or she can translate. The husband should be understanding of this. Or they can stay elsewhere"
38,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762d81,sprySquirrel,2020-04-23T16:27:57.831Z,I voted Yes.
38,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a08,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T17:06:40.391Z,This couple could speak French in private.
38,3,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225d,newSquirrel,2020-04-23T17:06:46.696Z,I stopped them and nicely told them that I find it disrespectful that they’re speaking language
38,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762d81,youngHippo,2020-04-23T17:06:49.988Z,I'm considering the fact that it's the mother's house and the son and his partner should be speaking English when she's there
38,3,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225d,newSquirrel,2020-04-23T17:06:54.543Z,My son told me that I was making big deal out of nothing and making everyone feel awkward.
38,3,5ea0ded69dc0406f8988c09b,conventionalBear,2020-04-23T17:06:55.177Z,"Everyone speaks English. The mother does not speak French. They are speaking French in front of her, and being extremely rude. The mother is not an asshole."
38,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e52,smallGorilla,2020-04-23T17:06:55.798Z,"I think the son and partner did not have malicious intentions, they were just creatures of habit and speaking a language that they normally speak with. The mother is taking it as if they were talking about her."
38,3,5ea1ab72de5d74641b66d75b,spryMonkey,2020-04-23T17:07:03.930Z,agreed. If they can both speak English than I think they should respect the mom in her home
38,3,5ea1b66cde5d74641b66face,snappyPig,2020-04-23T17:07:07.975Z,"If the mother did ask nicely to speak English then that should be that. The partner speaks English with an accent, there is nothing said about him not being comfortable to speak it."
38,3,5e9f0aa29dc0406f8987499b,likelyHorse,2020-04-23T17:07:16.277Z,"My son’s partner is French, but he can speak English,"
38,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762dea,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-23T17:07:16.733Z,The speaker isn't an asshole for wantiing to understand the conversation going on in front of her. The asshole is the husband of her son who has turned this into a competition of affection between him and his in-laws.
38,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a08,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T17:07:19.015Z,I agree since he can speak English it should be spoken around Mom.
38,3,5ea1b66cde5d74641b66face,snappyPig,2020-04-23T17:07:23.122Z,"If it was a private conversation between the son and partner, it can be talked about later."
38,3,5e9f0aa29dc0406f8987499b,likelyHorse,2020-04-23T17:07:25.420Z,he just has an accent.
38,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762d81,youngHippo,2020-04-23T17:07:30.521Z,The mother is not an asshole!
38,3,5e9f0aa29dc0406f8987499b,likelyHorse,2020-04-23T17:07:38.653Z,My son told me that I was making big deal out of nothing and making everyone feel awkward.
38,3,5ea1ab72de5d74641b66d75b,spryMonkey,2020-04-23T17:07:40.358Z,But the mother did ask and they walked away. I think they were being disrespectful even if it wasn't intentional. 
38,3,5ea0ded69dc0406f8988c09b,conventionalBear,2020-04-23T17:07:50.816Z,"It isn't even an important part of the story in this case, but they are also staying at her house."
38,3,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225d,newSquirrel,2020-04-23T17:07:54.679Z,"They both stopped talking, my son’s husband went upstairs pretty soon after that. "
38,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762d81,youngHippo,2020-04-23T17:08:00.169Z,"She has a right to politely ask, it may have an awkward in how she said it or whatever, but the idea behind it is OK. "
38,3,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225d,newSquirrel,2020-04-23T17:08:04.164Z,great escape
38,3,5ea1ab72de5d74641b66d75b,spryMonkey,2020-04-23T17:08:10.846Z,Walking away was rude
38,3,5e9f0aa29dc0406f8987499b,likelyHorse,2020-04-23T17:08:13.906Z,helping one
38,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a08,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T17:08:14.567Z,"Mom can feel like she is beging spoken about, as the host she is being disrespected.  It would be different if the partner could not speak english."
38,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e52,smallGorilla,2020-04-23T17:08:15.261Z,The son walked away might be because he felt the mother did not like him or something that upset him so he decided to leave the area and cool off.
38,3,5ea0ded69dc0406f8988c09b,conventionalBear,2020-04-23T17:08:28.520Z,"Exactly, she has a right to say something if she is being disrespected like that."
38,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762dea,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-23T17:08:31.189Z,I agree they were both being disrespectful fo the mother. The husband is the asshole here. And the son is supporting his husband's disrespectful actions.
38,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a08,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T17:08:33.953Z,I do think walking away was rude.
38,3,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225d,newSquirrel,2020-04-23T17:08:40.220Z,"Yesterday we were all in living room, they started talking, French of course. "
38,3,5ea0ded69dc0406f8988c09b,conventionalBear,2020-04-23T17:09:18.819Z,and she even said something in a polite way.
38,3,5ea1ab72de5d74641b66d75b,spryMonkey,2020-04-23T17:09:23.959Z,"How?! Instead of addressing the situation, he walked away. He was in wrong in the beginning and walked away so he wouldn't have to face the topic"
38,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762dea,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-23T17:09:28.102Z,Yes I agree. both were rude to leave her there. It's definitely the husband who is trying to make a competition of affection the son.
38,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a08,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T17:09:30.480Z,"I suppose that does cast some shade.  But, not enough to be disrespected. "
38,3,5ea0ded69dc0406f8988c09b,conventionalBear,2020-04-23T17:09:33.600Z,I see absolutely nothing here that says the mom is an asshole.
38,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e52,smallGorilla,2020-04-23T17:09:47.143Z,"The mother is not an asshole because she was voicing her opinion and expressing how she felt, they might have just taken it offesnively."
38,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762d81,youngHippo,2020-04-23T17:10:09.677Z,"It's legitimate to switch to a universal language - they are allowed to say some stuff in French, and of course in private, but in this case in the living room, they should been a little more inclusive, even 50%-50% would've been OK"
38,3,5ea1ab72de5d74641b66d75b,spryMonkey,2020-04-23T17:10:14.931Z,It could be miscommunication in how expectations were met
38,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a08,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T17:10:16.749Z,As mom claimes she was nice about it she is not really the ass hole. 
38,3,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225d,newSquirrel,2020-04-23T17:10:36.409Z,Could ut finish
38,3,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225d,newSquirrel,2020-04-23T17:10:44.017Z,could it finish
38,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a08,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T17:11:05.059Z,"Yes, it could be a miscommunication so perhaps a discussion should happen,  But that does not make her an ass hole. "
38,3,5ea0ded69dc0406f8988c09b,conventionalBear,2020-04-23T17:11:05.718Z,"I disagree with the 50-50, at least when they are all sitting together. All 3 speak English well. "
38,3,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225d,newSquirrel,2020-04-23T17:11:21.422Z,yeash reallly
38,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762dea,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-23T17:11:24.225Z,After considering all sides the blame lies primarily with the husband's rude behavior and the son supporting that behavior toward his mother. She was not an asshole to ask to understand English that both these men could easily speak .
38,3,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225d,newSquirrel,2020-04-23T17:11:26.159Z,yeash
38,3,5e9de5329dc0406f8987225d,newSquirrel,2020-04-23T17:11:30.107Z,yeah
38,3,5ea1ab72de5d74641b66d75b,spryMonkey,2020-04-23T17:11:36.250Z,I still don't think she was the asshole here. At all
38,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762d81,youngHippo,2020-04-23T17:11:38.771Z,"I mean to 50%-50% to HER, but if they're sitting on the couch... and they have a typical-slang-comment to make, they can"
38,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762dea,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-23T17:11:57.691Z,The speaker is not an asshole.
38,3,5ea0ded69dc0406f8988c09b,conventionalBear,2020-04-23T17:12:23.044Z,"So, in conclusion the writer did nothing wrong, and is not an asshole."

39,2,5ea1a668de5d74641b66d167,newBear,2020-04-23T17:32:56.255Z,I think this guy is an asshole.
39,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,littleGoat,2020-04-23T17:32:58.618Z,Sounds like a lot more is going on here than the English speaking issue.
39,2,5ea1a668de5d74641b66d167,newBear,2020-04-23T17:33:01.132Z,what about you?

39,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,littleGoat,2020-04-23T17:33:06.576Z,I think he is an asshole
39,2,5e9dec449dc0406f898726b6,culturedWolf,2020-04-23T17:33:22.403Z,yeah i think he is somewhat of an asshole
39,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,littleGoat,2020-04-23T17:33:25.728Z,He married into a Spanish speaking family. He isn't willing to help
39,2,5ea1a668de5d74641b66d167,newBear,2020-04-23T17:33:28.719Z,I think older people have a harder time learning a new language.
39,2,5ea13390de5d74641b66beae,niceOrangutan,2020-04-23T17:33:32.133Z,Agreed. I think he's not considering how difficult it can be for some people to learn a foreign language.
39,2,5ea1bd4cde5d74641b6704e8,conventionalCow,2020-04-23T17:33:34.686Z,"i agree , i think there are more problems then just the speaking issue"
39,2,5ea1bb26de5d74641b6702ec,niceHippo,2020-04-23T17:33:35.028Z,Its more than english in this story
39,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,littleGoat,2020-04-23T17:33:41.241Z,"That's true, I'm older and could never learn another language"
39,2,5ea1a668de5d74641b66d167,newBear,2020-04-23T17:33:45.120Z,true
39,2,5e9dec449dc0406f898726b6,culturedWolf,2020-04-23T17:34:00.820Z,"i agree, my parents are older and they struggle with learning the english language as well"
39,2,5ea13390de5d74641b66beae,niceOrangutan,2020-04-23T17:34:06.228Z,"And disrespectful to the mother in law. He should always be willing to help out family, even if it is extended family."
39,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630f1,newHorse,2020-04-23T17:34:13.480Z,I don't think the son in law is an asshole for wanting someone to be more independent. but I know it can be harder for someone to learn another language
39,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,littleGoat,2020-04-23T17:34:17.083Z,If this guy doesn't want to help he doesn't have to but he should be more respectful of his relatives.
39,2,5ea1a668de5d74641b66d167,newBear,2020-04-23T17:34:25.536Z,"the fact that she reaches out to him and he's ""annoyed"" helping her really rubbed me the wrong way."
39,2,5ea1bb26de5d74641b6702ec,niceHippo,2020-04-23T17:34:28.377Z,I've been to other countries and not been welcomed because i couldn't speak their language
39,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630f1,newHorse,2020-04-23T17:34:48.203Z,sounds like hes been helping for 8 years
39,2,5ea1bd4cde5d74641b6704e8,conventionalCow,2020-04-23T17:34:53.123Z,I think she was just wanting to spend time with him as well since she is his mother in law
39,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,littleGoat,2020-04-23T17:35:01.321Z,Thats true niceHippo but this guy married into a Spanish speaking family. Different from just visiting a country.
39,2,5e9dec449dc0406f898726b6,culturedWolf,2020-04-23T17:35:31.300Z,"I can understand how he can get frustrated with being the translator for that long, but I mean he knew what he was going into and he can't expect her to learn a new language fast enough like he did"
39,2,5ea1bd4cde5d74641b6704e8,conventionalCow,2020-04-23T17:35:32.644Z,He should of been more considerate considering he knew that
39,2,5ea1a668de5d74641b66d167,newBear,2020-04-23T17:35:34.910Z,is there a limit on helping family members when it is something you can easily do?
39,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,littleGoat,2020-04-23T17:35:38.776Z,There's a lot more to the story. Maybe she is demanding. Maybe he is just an asshole. But he sounds passive-aggressive and I vote for asshole.
39,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630f1,newHorse,2020-04-23T17:35:39.176Z,he could be working and not be able to translate every time she needed something
39,2,5ea13390de5d74641b66beae,niceOrangutan,2020-04-23T17:35:40.071Z,"I think he could have pushed back on helping as much in a different way, one that didn't offend her."
39,2,5ea1bb26de5d74641b6702ec,niceHippo,2020-04-23T17:35:42.813Z,"Yeah, maybe he should have thought about that"
39,2,5ea1bd4cde5d74641b6704e8,conventionalCow,2020-04-23T17:36:14.103Z,He could of even explained to his wife about this and maybe she could of explained better
39,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630f1,newHorse,2020-04-23T17:36:20.696Z,true
39,2,5e9dec449dc0406f898726b6,culturedWolf,2020-04-23T17:36:23.900Z,that is true
39,2,5ea1a668de5d74641b66d167,newBear,2020-04-23T17:36:28.764Z,I would agree with what someone said. The mother-in-law could be really needy and demanding.
39,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,littleGoat,2020-04-23T17:36:34.127Z,He needs to be nicer to his mother in law. Or just avoid her. But don't be rude to her.
39,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630f1,newHorse,2020-04-23T17:36:43.240Z,I would be frustrated after 8 years too
39,2,5ea13390de5d74641b66beae,niceOrangutan,2020-04-23T17:36:59.052Z,"The wife probably would have been a good route to go, versus handling it directly."
39,2,5ea1bb26de5d74641b6702ec,niceHippo,2020-04-23T17:37:01.646Z,the 8 years is a bit much
39,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,littleGoat,2020-04-23T17:37:04.753Z,It would be frustrating.
39,2,5ea1a668de5d74641b66d167,newBear,2020-04-23T17:37:14.369Z,While it would be frustrating the guy still handled it wrong. 
39,2,5e9dec449dc0406f898726b6,culturedWolf,2020-04-23T17:37:20.280Z,yeah he did
39,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,littleGoat,2020-04-23T17:37:26.059Z,Some people are never able to learn a new language though. Especially when older.
39,2,5ea1bd4cde5d74641b6704e8,conventionalCow,2020-04-23T17:37:33.761Z,Yeah 8 years and his wife never said anything to her mother about it either seems weird
39,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,littleGoat,2020-04-23T17:37:35.777Z,He had a bad attitude about the whole thing.
39,2,5ea13390de5d74641b66beae,niceOrangutan,2020-04-23T17:37:42.954Z,"Agreed, he definitely handled it the wrong way."
39,2,5e9dec449dc0406f898726b6,culturedWolf,2020-04-23T17:37:54.461Z,well i vote he is an asshole
39,2,5ea13390de5d74641b66beae,niceOrangutan,2020-04-23T17:37:55.823Z,the bad attitude is apparent throughout his whole write-up.
39,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,littleGoat,2020-04-23T17:38:00.793Z,I vote for asshole too.
39,2,5ea1bb26de5d74641b6702ec,niceHippo,2020-04-23T17:38:04.619Z,I've learned multiple languages and never really use them
39,2,5ea13390de5d74641b66beae,niceOrangutan,2020-04-23T17:38:16.137Z,Also voting for asshole.
39,2,5ea1a668de5d74641b66d167,newBear,2020-04-23T17:38:21.571Z,I'm voting that the guy is an asshole. 
39,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,littleGoat,2020-04-23T17:38:53.937Z,He could have handled it a lot better. He's an asshole.

39,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630f1,smallGorilla,2020-04-23T17:47:57.835Z,this one is hard!
39,3,5ea1bd4cde5d74641b6704e8,culturedBison,2020-04-23T17:48:02.124Z,I do not think they are an asshole in this situation
39,3,5ea1a668de5d74641b66d167,youngGiraffe,2020-04-23T17:48:05.366Z,This one was harder for me to decide. I'm  a little on the fence if she's an asshole or not.
39,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,niceRabbit,2020-04-23T17:48:11.054Z,"This is a hard call. He should be more patient, but he shouldn't have all the translation duties either."
39,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630f1,smallGorilla,2020-04-23T17:48:11.279Z,me too
39,3,5e9dec449dc0406f898726b6,newRhino,2020-04-23T17:48:13.065Z,i dont think they are the asshole either 
39,3,5e9dec449dc0406f898726b6,newRhino,2020-04-23T17:48:18.593Z,but i think the dude is
39,3,5ea1bd4cde5d74641b6704e8,culturedBison,2020-04-23T17:48:19.084Z,I think they could of handled it better yes
39,3,5ea1bd4cde5d74641b6704e8,culturedBison,2020-04-23T17:48:22.574Z,but not an asshole
39,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,niceRabbit,2020-04-23T17:48:22.969Z,I don't think anyone is the asshole here.
39,3,5ea13390de5d74641b66beae,smallHorse,2020-04-23T17:48:26.412Z,Agreed; I don't think she's the asshole. I don't think her expectations are unreasonable.
39,3,5ea1bb26de5d74641b6702ec,culturedDonkey,2020-04-23T17:48:30.465Z,no assholes
39,3,5ea1a668de5d74641b66d167,youngGiraffe,2020-04-23T17:48:30.895Z,I do think it should be the actual daughter that has more of hand in helping her mother.
39,3,5e9dec449dc0406f898726b6,newRhino,2020-04-23T17:48:38.577Z,that i agree with!
39,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,niceRabbit,2020-04-23T17:48:45.009Z,"The guy isn't refusing, he's just getting tired of being the only translator"
39,3,5ea13390de5d74641b66beae,smallHorse,2020-04-23T17:48:54.594Z,She seems like she's really busy - a full time job and full-time school.
39,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,niceRabbit,2020-04-23T17:48:54.977Z,And I think the wife has a bit of an attitude about the whole thing
39,3,5ea1a668de5d74641b66d167,youngGiraffe,2020-04-23T17:49:02.537Z,agreed
39,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630f1,smallGorilla,2020-04-23T17:49:04.822Z,they should share the responsibility 
39,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,niceRabbit,2020-04-23T17:49:11.920Z,"Yes, share it!"
39,3,5ea1bb26de5d74641b6702ec,culturedDonkey,2020-04-23T17:49:15.177Z,the wife seems to have lots of attitude
39,3,5ea1bd4cde5d74641b6704e8,culturedBison,2020-04-23T17:49:20.709Z,"agreed , the daughter should of been helping out more , especially with her remark of why cant he take 10 minutes out of his day"
39,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630f1,smallGorilla,2020-04-23T17:49:21.286Z,wifey does seem to have an attitude like. id id it my whole life now its my husbands turn
39,3,5ea13390de5d74641b66beae,smallHorse,2020-04-23T17:49:22.135Z,"if he is more available, then I understand why it more often falls to him."
39,3,5e9dec449dc0406f898726b6,newRhino,2020-04-23T17:49:24.062Z,i think she is sort of being a hypocrite though because she claims it only takes 10 minutes out of his time but they are both as busy
39,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,niceRabbit,2020-04-23T17:49:25.448Z,The parents are not going to learn English at this point
39,3,5ea1bd4cde5d74641b6704e8,culturedBison,2020-04-23T17:50:17.749Z,She could of helped her parents learn
39,3,5ea1bd4cde5d74641b6704e8,culturedBison,2020-04-23T17:51:19.590Z,I feel like she could of worked with him to handle this better. instead of leaving him to handle all of it.
39,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,niceRabbit,2020-04-23T17:51:30.196Z,"Agreed, she should have helped"
39,3,5ea13390de5d74641b66beae,smallHorse,2020-04-23T17:51:40.752Z,I don't think she was being unreasonable.
39,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,niceRabbit,2020-04-23T17:51:52.403Z,"I think he is a decent guy, he is just tired of being the translator all the time."
39,3,5ea13390de5d74641b66beae,smallHorse,2020-04-23T17:52:03.787Z,The guy never re-directed the calls back to her...
39,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,niceRabbit,2020-04-23T17:52:35.390Z,"True, he could have handled it different. But he's not an asshole, just maybe could handle it differently"
39,3,5ea1bd4cde5d74641b6704e8,culturedBison,2020-04-23T17:52:50.165Z,he could of done that but at the same time if it kept happening over and over the daughter could of stepped in and spoke to her mom about it
39,3,5ea13390de5d74641b66beae,smallHorse,2020-04-23T17:53:18.652Z,I don't think they are communicating well between each other
39,3,5ea13390de5d74641b66beae,smallHorse,2020-04-23T17:53:59.218Z,"She didn't understand how he really feels about it, but its not her fault, because he clearly didn't communicate them well."
39,3,5ea13390de5d74641b66beae,smallHorse,2020-04-23T17:54:08.348Z,"Anyway, not the asshole is my vote."
39,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630f1,smallGorilla,2020-04-23T17:54:16.847Z,agreed
39,3,5ea1bd4cde5d74641b6704e8,culturedBison,2020-04-23T17:54:17.166Z,same
39,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f2e,niceRabbit,2020-04-23T17:54:20.104Z,Not from me
40,0,5ea1bc66de5d74641b6704c6,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-23T17:57:32.471Z,"I do not think this person is the asshole, though I do think she shouldn't always pass the phone to her spouse. I think she needs to explain to him she is extremely stressed out and appreciates his help. "
40,0,5ea0e0529dc0406f8988c4c6,snappySquirrel,2020-04-23T17:57:56.510Z,I think the person is the asshole. It's not fair to inconvenience the husband. The parents can try to start some classes and work to improve English. I think the husband can offer a little time but not drop what he is doing all the time.
40,0,5ea0f0f69dc0406f8988e1fc,snappyRhino,2020-04-23T17:58:04.096Z,"I don't think the person is an asshole for wanting to help their parents, but I do think she is an asshole for making her husband take on all the duties. They are her parents, not his. She should ask him first."
40,0,5ea097789dc0406f8988302a,spryLion,2020-04-23T17:58:07.771Z,"I don't think she is an asshole for expecting her husband to help out  a bit. Especially with the husband's handling of the situation, However I do think having to constantly have this responsibility of helping your SO's parents is unfair."

40,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763ad8,conventionalWolf,2020-04-23T17:58:39.991Z,I think that this person is being one but so is her husband.  This is something that they should have talked about way before she told him to start doing this.  I think that in the future she should still ask him but not as much. 
40,0,5ea1b78ede5d74641b66fda3,niceHippo,2020-04-23T17:59:09.340Z,My initial thought is that he should be willing to help since he did marry into her family. Then you can think that she put her mom off on him because she got tired of it. Her parents should take the initiative to learn English. 
40,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7631b6,spryDonkey,2020-04-23T17:59:19.786Z,"I do think they are an asshole.  Why do they make fun of him for being a ""gringo""?  Does he make fun of them for being hispanic?  I doubt it - that would be racist.  "
40,0,5ea0deb89dc0406f8988c091,culturedPig,2020-04-23T17:59:20.661Z,I think that the mother should ask both parties to translate. If the wife is there she should take care of it. 
40,0,5ea1bc66de5d74641b6704c6,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-23T17:59:35.603Z,"His comments make him out to be a bigger asshole than she is for handing the phone over,  but it sounds like everyone is a bit stressed and not expressing feelings about the conversations."
40,0,5ea097789dc0406f8988302a,spryLion,2020-04-23T17:59:40.584Z,"Also, I am assuming this is somewhat present day, there are alot of translating tools on the internet today. She needs to setup these tools for her parents so they are not constantly calling for help."
40,0,5ea0deb89dc0406f8988c091,culturedPig,2020-04-23T17:59:59.931Z,I agree that they aren't both expressing their feelings. I also think perhaps talking to the mother could help.

40,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763ad8,conventionalWolf,2020-04-23T18:01:03.779Z,I think that the problem is that they are surrounded by spanish speakers and have no reason to learn.  Especially if the daughter translates
40,0,5ea0f0f69dc0406f8988e1fc,snappyRhino,2020-04-23T18:01:38.588Z,"Yeah, it's not about the parents, it's about OP expecting her husband to take on all the labor of translating."
40,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7631b6,spryDonkey,2020-04-23T18:01:46.346Z,Like spryLion said there are lots of tools out there to learn English - why rely on someone else all the time?  Help yourself and learn to speak the language in the country that you're living in
40,0,5ea0deb89dc0406f8988c091,culturedPig,2020-04-23T18:01:46.416Z,I think that the husband is the asshole based on his comments and his unwillingness to help his wife and her family. I doubt it is an everyday occurrence 
40,0,5ea1b78ede5d74641b66fda3,niceHippo,2020-04-23T18:02:07.035Z,This is something that they should sit down and talk about together. Maybe the daughter could try teaching her parents English herself since she thinks that its a privilege. 
40,0,5ea1bc66de5d74641b6704c6,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-23T18:02:11.259Z,I think she just needs to be honest with her husband about her school and workload and express she really appreciates his help. She should also try to not always use him as the translator but step in when she can. 
40,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7631b6,spryDonkey,2020-04-23T18:02:22.108Z,You live in America - you learn to speak English!  If I moved to Spain I would learn to speak Spanish
40,0,5ea0e0529dc0406f8988c4c6,snappySquirrel,2020-04-23T18:02:29.580Z,I think the wife shouldn't automatically assume that her husband can help out whenever. The husband should set boundaries.
40,0,5ea097789dc0406f8988302a,spryLion,2020-04-23T18:02:41.189Z,"I believe she is somewhat an asshole in this, but hey are bot going about this the wron way"
40,0,5ea0e0529dc0406f8988c4c6,snappySquirrel,2020-04-23T18:02:51.807Z,The wife isn't being fair and thinking about resources like Google Translate to help her parents.

40,1,5ea097789dc0406f8988302a,spryPig,2020-04-23T18:11:33.804Z,I do not think he is an asshole. Remember he stated he was polite when bringing up the issue to his MIL. He is just venting on the reddit post.
40,1,5ea0f0f69dc0406f8988e1fc,likelyRabbit,2020-04-23T18:11:36.437Z,"His attitude is what makes him seem like an asshole to me. I get that he's frustrated, but learning new languages isn't easy for everyone."
40,1,5ea1bc66de5d74641b6704c6,spryGoat,2020-04-23T18:11:44.500Z,My initial thought was this guy was being a bit petty. Is it that difficult to have a quick conversation with a family member when they need help? It isn't always so easy to learn a new language later in life. 
40,1,5ea0e0529dc0406f8988c4c6,littleDonkey,2020-04-23T18:11:48.843Z,I don't think the husband is the asshole. He's not nice at what he's writing but he says he acts politely and offers resources for them to help themselves.

40,1,5ea0deb89dc0406f8988c091,nicePanda,2020-04-23T18:12:04.280Z,Some elder members of families like that just won't learn the language and it's not up to the husband to decide.

41,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f7e,spryCow,2020-04-23T18:18:28.292Z,But the French guy should not have huffed out of the room.
41,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763f3a,culturedDonkey,2020-04-23T18:18:35.881Z,Agreed that the way she handled it made her the asshole.  
41,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763f3a,culturedDonkey,2020-04-23T18:18:45.959Z,"I think that's what this situation is about, not anything that happened afterwards "
41,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f7e,spryCow,2020-04-23T18:18:57.334Z,Do not agree. She was justified. Her son was actually the asshole.
41,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762a2a,youngBear,2020-04-23T18:19:04.392Z,So is anyone planning on not voting asshole?
41,0,5ea1d46cde5d74641b671c8f,conventionalPig,2020-04-23T18:19:07.982Z,"the french guy should have said how he felt and not walked out, they should try to understand everyones view."
41,0,5e821b4050f6e364321d5499,culturedPanda,2020-04-23T18:19:19.266Z,Yes but the French guy is also only 20 years old
41,0,5ea1d46cde5d74641b671c8f,conventionalPig,2020-04-23T18:19:20.754Z,not asshole 
41,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762f7e,spryCow,2020-04-23T18:19:27.978Z,I will not vote that she was an asshole because it is not true
41,0,5ea1d46cde5d74641b671c8f,conventionalPig,2020-04-23T18:19:52.050Z,"i also will not vote she is an asshole, because she is not."
41,2,5e821b4050f6e364321d5499,snappyCow,2020-04-23T18:44:12.935Z,So are they the asshole?
41,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f7e,conventionalBison,2020-04-23T18:44:19.402Z,He's an asshole. If he had no intention of conversing with his mother he should not have visited.
41,2,5ea1d46cde5d74641b671c8f,conventionalGoat,2020-04-23T18:44:24.885Z,"No, he is not an asshole. He could have explained himself to his mother \"
41,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f3a,snappyHippo,2020-04-23T18:44:28.643Z,"I'm really not sure how I feel in this situation.  I think both sides have valid points, however I think that making your partner comfortable is important?"
41,2,5ea0dcce9dc0406f8988bbd8,niceWolf,2020-04-23T18:44:37.770Z,Obviously very similar to the first scenario.  I feel he is being an asshole by not including his mother.  
41,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762a2a,spryLion,2020-04-23T18:44:43.869Z,"This is more difficult to decide from the point of view of the person who is just stuck in the middle and trying to please everyone.  I would be inclined to say that he's not an asshole, he's just in a difficult situation."
41,2,5ea1d46cde5d74641b671c8f,conventionalGoat,2020-04-23T18:44:48.161Z,he should however include her because they are in her house 
41,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f3a,snappyHippo,2020-04-23T18:44:50.943Z,"Also, it wasn't mentioned that he wasn't talking to her at all. "
41,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f7e,conventionalBison,2020-04-23T18:45:03.713Z,"Of course the partner should be comfortable, but he has to make accomodations if he is going to visit the mother."
41,2,5e821b4050f6e364321d5499,snappyCow,2020-04-23T18:45:13.597Z,"I think making your partner comfortable is important but in this scenario, I think the poster is the asshole."
41,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762a2a,spryLion,2020-04-23T18:45:22.910Z,"He's trying to keep his husband happy and comfortable.  He doesn't want to be excluding his mother, but doesn't know what to do.  His intentions are good."
41,2,5ea0dcce9dc0406f8988bbd8,niceWolf,2020-04-23T18:45:24.895Z,I agree snappyCow
41,2,5ea1d46cde5d74641b671c8f,conventionalGoat,2020-04-23T18:45:31.739Z,I am on the same page as you spryLion
41,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f7e,conventionalBison,2020-04-23T18:45:32.785Z,"After all, that's why they have come - for her."
41,2,5ea0dcce9dc0406f8988bbd8,niceWolf,2020-04-23T18:46:12.679Z,The husband speaks English I believe it said but just that he feels silly when he cannot think of the correct word.  I would guess that the mother wouldn't make fun of her son's partner for this.
41,2,5e821b4050f6e364321d5499,snappyCow,2020-04-23T18:46:14.518Z,The intentions while good are a little misguided as they are making the mother uncomfortable in her home even after the mother brought it to her attention politely.
41,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f7e,conventionalBison,2020-04-23T18:46:25.193Z,I have been in this situation before. Sometimes visiting inlaws is uncomfortable but you make an extra effort.
41,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f3a,snappyHippo,2020-04-23T18:46:26.604Z,I feel like both have valid points.  
41,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f3a,snappyHippo,2020-04-23T18:46:41.079Z,I guess maybe the son is the asshole here.  Perhaps the partner could make more of an effort?  
41,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f3a,snappyHippo,2020-04-23T18:46:53.616Z,"Yes, conventionalBison I agree"
41,2,5ea0dcce9dc0406f8988bbd8,niceWolf,2020-04-23T18:46:55.180Z,I agree with that snappyHippo
41,2,5ea1d46cde5d74641b671c8f,conventionalGoat,2020-04-23T18:47:10.976Z,they could all try something. the boyfriend should try to speak English sometimes and the son translate sometime and the mother should know to let them have their own conversation
41,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f3a,snappyHippo,2020-04-23T18:47:13.969Z,It just feels like no one is outwardly a huge asshole here but I guess we have to choose.  
41,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f7e,conventionalBison,2020-04-23T18:47:17.955Z,I agree too. Poster is asshole - although there are nuances.
41,2,5e821b4050f6e364321d5499,snappyCow,2020-04-23T18:47:23.224Z,I agree with snappyHippo as well. 
41,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762a2a,spryLion,2020-04-23T18:47:28.878Z,I could go either way.  I don't feel strongly.  
41,2,5ea0dcce9dc0406f8988bbd8,niceWolf,2020-04-23T18:47:34.823Z,Yeah just seems like they need to sit down and communicate and let each other know how they are feeling and figure it out.
41,2,5e821b4050f6e364321d5499,snappyCow,2020-04-23T18:47:47.054Z,Exactly nic
41,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f7e,conventionalBison,2020-04-23T18:47:50.062Z,The only way they can do that is in English.
41,2,5ea0dcce9dc0406f8988bbd8,niceWolf,2020-04-23T18:48:12.896Z,Good point.
41,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762a2a,spryLion,2020-04-23T18:48:13.523Z,"Haha, true conventionalBison"
41,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f7e,conventionalBison,2020-04-23T18:48:40.739Z,I think we are agreed here.
41,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f3a,snappyHippo,2020-04-23T18:48:43.183Z,"Okay, I have my answer.  "
41,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762a2a,spryLion,2020-04-23T18:48:55.018Z,"I really do not believe that he's an asshole because he's not trying to be one, but I will vote asshole if the majority agrees."
41,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f3a,snappyHippo,2020-04-23T18:49:03.271Z,"The son is the asshole, and yes conventionalBison I think we all agree"
41,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f7e,conventionalBison,2020-04-23T18:49:09.368Z,"Thanks, Lion."
41,2,5ea0dcce9dc0406f8988bbd8,niceWolf,2020-04-23T18:49:14.328Z,I agree sounds good.
41,2,5e821b4050f6e364321d5499,snappyCow,2020-04-23T18:49:18.851Z,I agree as well
41,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f3a,snappyHippo,2020-04-23T18:49:25.277Z,"I also don't really think he's an asshole either, but we have to choose. "
42,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7631f3,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T18:20:13.826Z,Speaking a language does not make you an asshole
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762aa4,youngDonkey,2020-04-23T18:20:14.170Z,"I have a lot of friends who have family and spouses that speak different languages. I think its a tricky thing,  but its important for everyone to be patient when another language is being spoken"
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762aa4,youngDonkey,2020-04-23T18:20:20.266Z,I don't think the woman is an asshole
42,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,likelyBear,2020-04-23T18:20:30.059Z,I don't think either of them is the asshole. I think that should be an option. The mother hasn't seen her daughter and wants to interact with her. She doesn't know German. The daughter wants to make her significant other comfortable. 
42,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7631f3,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T18:20:33.852Z,The mother is an asshole for not understanding
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-23T18:20:44.248Z,I think they should have spoken in English.
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-23T18:21:07.608Z,They went to meet their mother only for the weekend. 
42,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7631f3,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T18:21:19.287Z,The mother should learn German; while the husband should learn English.
42,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca3,newPig,2020-04-23T18:21:24.586Z,I dont belive that the woman is an asshole at all.  The woman is communicating with her husband and they should be the priority to one another.  The mother is being a little unreasonable and should be more understanding of others. 
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762aa4,youngDonkey,2020-04-23T18:21:30.795Z,"I think the husband probably felt really shy and out of place, so it might be nice for the mom to learn some basic german"
42,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,likelyBear,2020-04-23T18:21:33.344Z,I suppose it doesn't say specifically if the OP is a male or female. 
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-23T18:21:36.976Z,Mother is too old to learn German now.

42,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca3,newPig,2020-04-23T18:22:01.911Z,The mother and daugher go off on their own for a period of time to catch up if thats what he mother wants.
42,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,likelyBear,2020-04-23T18:22:02.881Z,Or he can speak german and his spouse can translate.
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bca,spryOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:22:12.232Z,good idea
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-23T18:22:12.823Z,Husband can speak little English.
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bca,spryOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:22:30.207Z,husband can eat meals

42,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,likelyBear,2020-04-23T18:23:05.687Z,The OP has a lot of time with the spouse. If they're in a separate bedroom or something they can speak German but if they're in a common area it doesn't seem right to exclude the mother. 
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bca,spryOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:23:18.281Z,I think one can talk in his phone and it will translate for him
42,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca3,newPig,2020-04-23T18:23:36.403Z,The daugher can translate on the fly for the mother if its something that she should be included on.
42,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,likelyBear,2020-04-23T18:23:39.424Z,"Yeah, I think that there are a lot of solutions to this issue. "
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bca,spryOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:23:46.441Z,a spanish employee did this phone thing at a store for me
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-23T18:23:47.315Z,"She could have talked with her husband in German in between, but mainly the group talk should be in English."
42,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,likelyBear,2020-04-23T18:23:53.611Z,I think it's the daughter that has to change but I don't think she's the asshole really. 
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-23T18:24:14.431Z,I think daughter is the asshole.
42,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca3,newPig,2020-04-23T18:24:20.339Z,I think that the mother might have some issues with the husband himself if something that petty is bugging her.
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bca,spryOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:24:23.769Z,are the meals american or german???
42,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,likelyBear,2020-04-23T18:24:38.174Z,I think the style of food is irrelevant
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bca,spryOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:24:46.724Z,Bet he will eat American food...lol
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-23T18:24:55.371Z,Doesnt matter for the meals to be American or German.
42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-23T18:25:05.232Z,Yes
42,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca3,newPig,2020-04-23T18:25:08.848Z,No she is not an asshole

42,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-23T18:25:51.452Z,That is why she is an asshole. She should have balanced both sides.
42,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,likelyBear,2020-04-23T18:26:02.507Z,It's a tricky situation though.

42,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7631f3,niceMonkey,2020-04-23T18:49:48.382Z,She is slightly an asshole for implacing judgement onto others
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,likelyCow,2020-04-23T18:49:50.107Z,I think the son is doing wrong
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,conventionalPanda,2020-04-23T18:50:08.390Z,This one seems really similar to Round 1 but in Round 1 I voted the opposite way. I think the mother is the asshole here. She isn't the asshole because she feels left out but the way she brought it up was kind of mean. 
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,likelyCow,2020-04-23T18:50:13.709Z,She politely told them to talk in English

42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bca,spryGiraffe,2020-04-23T18:50:20.042Z,Overall I believe it is alright for the parents to ask for help once in a while.i 
42,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7631f3,niceMonkey,2020-04-23T18:50:24.067Z,I am honestly 50/50.
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,conventionalPanda,2020-04-23T18:50:31.902Z,Telling your son and his partner that they're being disrespectful isn't polite. 
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,likelyCow,2020-04-23T18:50:36.687Z,I also favor mom
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bca,spryGiraffe,2020-04-23T18:50:38.996Z,The boys can talk French in the bedroom
42,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7631f3,niceMonkey,2020-04-23T18:50:53.768Z,I agree spryGiraffe she should be able to communicate with son

42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,likelyCow,2020-04-23T18:50:59.508Z,Yes they should talk common language in group
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,conventionalPanda,2020-04-23T18:50:59.994Z,They can talk French in the bedroom but there's a nicer way to let them know. 
42,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7631f3,niceMonkey,2020-04-23T18:51:06.831Z,but the son has the ultimate choice
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca3,likelyHippo,2020-04-23T18:51:17.035Z,They they are in her house and they can be respectful of her while she is putting them up and providing a place for them while they visit.
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,conventionalPanda,2020-04-23T18:51:19.967Z,I think she's the asshole because of the way she addressed it
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,likelyCow,2020-04-23T18:51:25.295Z,and the husband should not get up and go
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bca,spryGiraffe,2020-04-23T18:51:30.916Z,How would you like your child doing this to you?
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762aa4,niceRhino,2020-04-23T18:51:34.441Z,Yeah the husband shouldn't have reacted that way
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,likelyCow,2020-04-23T18:51:40.564Z,very disrespectful
42,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7631f3,niceMonkey,2020-04-23T18:51:43.882Z,lol
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,conventionalPanda,2020-04-23T18:51:47.674Z,If I was the mother in that situation I would speak to my son separately about it. 
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,likelyCow,2020-04-23T18:51:55.897Z,same here
42,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7631f3,niceMonkey,2020-04-23T18:52:03.621Z,are y'all real tho?
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,conventionalPanda,2020-04-23T18:52:11.654Z,Let him know that I'd like to be included in the conversation too and have him talk to his partner about it
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,conventionalPanda,2020-04-23T18:52:14.542Z,"Yeah, I'm real"
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,likelyCow,2020-04-23T18:52:16.163Z,son should have talked to husband separately
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762aa4,niceRhino,2020-04-23T18:52:22.678Z,I'm real lol
42,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7631f3,niceMonkey,2020-04-23T18:52:33.293Z,cool :)
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762aa4,niceRhino,2020-04-23T18:52:38.867Z,I feel like the mother should have approached her son separately
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,likelyCow,2020-04-23T18:52:41.664Z,i am real too
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,conventionalPanda,2020-04-23T18:52:46.351Z,"Yeah, I agree niceRhino"
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca3,likelyHippo,2020-04-23T18:52:50.426Z,i am a robot. beep beep. 
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,conventionalPanda,2020-04-23T18:52:54.479Z,and I think that's what makes the OP the asshole
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,likelyCow,2020-04-23T18:52:58.683Z,but they should have respected mother
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,conventionalPanda,2020-04-23T18:53:15.136Z,From their standpoint they weren't being disrespectful 
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,likelyCow,2020-04-23T18:53:36.782Z,you do not become small in speaking in a language that is understood by all
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca3,likelyHippo,2020-04-23T18:53:49.010Z,The son is used to ignoring his mom so it wasnt an issue for him most likely.
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,conventionalPanda,2020-04-23T18:53:56.399Z,If the mother talked to her son separately and then he got upset and continued to only speak in French then the OP wouldn't be the asshole
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,likelyCow,2020-04-23T18:53:56.679Z,private discussion in bedroom
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,conventionalPanda,2020-04-23T18:54:08.532Z,but I think the way she dealt with it makes her the asshole 
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,likelyCow,2020-04-23T18:54:20.548Z,i feel she was right 
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bca,spryGiraffe,2020-04-23T18:54:30.246Z,The mom should hide her phone with the translator app on
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,likelyCow,2020-04-23T18:54:39.869Z,funny idea
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,conventionalPanda,2020-04-23T18:54:44.354Z,It sounds like the son is used to speaking with his partner in French
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca3,likelyHippo,2020-04-23T18:54:49.799Z,"Moms house, moms rules.  You dont like it? Pack your sh*t and get out. "
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bd2,likelyCow,2020-04-23T18:55:07.683Z,i favor mom. she is not asshole.
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762aa4,niceRhino,2020-04-23T18:55:12.005Z,I think the approach was a bit asshole-ish
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,conventionalPanda,2020-04-23T18:55:30.350Z,They're only visiting for a week
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,conventionalPanda,2020-04-23T18:55:46.887Z,They're guests in her home
42,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762bca,spryGiraffe,2020-04-23T18:55:46.892Z,The mom is not an asshole. She is being left out. The boys could keep quiet or speak Fench in the bedroom or an alternate private area.
42,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762dda,conventionalPanda,2020-04-23T18:55:59.229Z,and she make her son's partner feel bad 
43,0,5ea1d700de5d74641b671ed0,likelyBear,2020-04-23T18:25:54.457Z,"I think he is not an asshole. No way. Think about it from his shoe, it would get really annoying. Plus he was polite about it and he gave her the resources to do it like duolingo. "
43,0,5ea1d700de5d74641b671ed0,likelyBear,2020-04-23T18:27:16.285Z,"(My Last Sentence) He also helped her for a while, and he gave her lots of time to learn English and also was giving her support to learn English."
43,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76281b,littleRabbit,2020-04-23T18:27:35.663Z,"I don't think he's the asshole either, he has been helpful, and I can see how it would get obnoxious. "
43,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762c1d,culturedGoat,2020-04-23T18:27:49.779Z,I am torn because he says he was polite to his mother-in-law yet is not polite at all in what he writes.  Familes ask ech other to do things for each other.  That can get annoying but families annoy each other all the time.
43,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76281b,littleRabbit,2020-04-23T18:28:12.682Z,"This is true, his tone is super rude and condescending. "
43,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76281b,littleRabbit,2020-04-23T18:28:19.001Z,It makes the decision difficult.
43,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7636cd,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:28:23.337Z,I think he was the asshole.  The mother in law was  made to feel like a burden. The feelings of being put out were very apparent in his post and can come through no matter how polite you are.   
43,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76281b,littleRabbit,2020-04-23T18:28:40.627Z,Now I am torn!
43,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762c1d,culturedGoat,2020-04-23T18:28:49.623Z,"Yes I agree with you.  He thinks he is being nice, but he isn't."
43,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7627c6,spryDonkey,2020-04-23T18:28:54.293Z,"This was a bit of a tossup for me but I'm going with he is the asshole. The way he wrote his post doesn't sound to me like he was being very polite about it, especially the sentence he wrote in his ""Edit""."
43,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7636cd,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:29:19.394Z,"that being said, i think if he had talked to his wife first and discussed out to approach his mother in law with this, it might have gone smoother"
43,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762c1d,culturedGoat,2020-04-23T18:29:25.075Z,I feel as if he is just making excuses for poor behavior.
43,0,5ea1d700de5d74641b671ed0,likelyBear,2020-04-23T18:29:33.917Z,we got 2 minutes guys
43,0,5ea1d700de5d74641b671ed0,likelyBear,2020-04-23T18:29:39.372Z,i dont think he is an asshole
43,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762c1d,culturedGoat,2020-04-23T18:29:44.053Z,I think he is an asshole.
43,0,5ea1d700de5d74641b671ed0,likelyBear,2020-04-23T18:29:47.160Z,who agrees and disagrees
43,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76281b,littleRabbit,2020-04-23T18:29:47.294Z,You're right. I'm changing my vote to he is the asshole.
43,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7627c6,spryDonkey,2020-04-23T18:29:55.909Z,I think he was an asshole.
43,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7636cd,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:30:02.768Z,"asshole, this could have been handled better"
43,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762c1d,culturedGoat,2020-04-23T18:30:17.634Z,yes  ass hole
43,0,5ea1d700de5d74641b671ed0,likelyBear,2020-04-23T18:30:21.651Z,asshole
43,2,5d482ea621c9be351f76281b,culturedWolf,2020-04-23T18:54:38.101Z,I don't think she is the asshole. 
43,2,5d482ea621c9be351f76281b,culturedWolf,2020-04-23T18:55:01.571Z,"I get her husband being annoyed, but at the same time he is part of the family and it's not that hard to help out. "
43,2,5d482ea621c9be351f76281b,culturedWolf,2020-04-23T18:55:15.117Z,I would want my husband to do the same thing. 
43,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762c1d,snappyHippo,2020-04-23T18:55:31.003Z,This is difficult because she refers to her husband as a gringo and expects him to help a lot.  Her family has been in the country quite a while.
43,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7636cd,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T18:55:39.691Z,"i am a litle back and forth on this one,  The wife is not respecting her husband feelings on the matter"
43,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762c1d,snappyHippo,2020-04-23T18:56:14.925Z,"How much time is involved here?  She says not very much, but the husband feels it is a lot a time."
43,2,5ea1d700de5d74641b671ed0,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-23T18:56:29.645Z,The husbands is gotta step up to the plate. Thats family plus he is not even busy. It takes 10 minutes. She is not an asshole
43,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7627c6,littleHorse,2020-04-23T18:56:35.482Z,"Tough one, but I don't think she was the asshole for asking him to help translate every once in awhile. But calling him a ""gringo"" and not considering his feelings is a little asshole-ish on her part as well."
43,2,5ea1d700de5d74641b671ed0,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-23T18:56:45.758Z,Thats a reasonable thing to ask from your husband like what
43,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7636cd,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T18:56:55.469Z,"But, the husband does have more time to help out the mother in law.  Anew language is hard,  and for older people changing their thought proccess is difficult"
43,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7636cd,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T18:57:27.498Z,This family needs to sit down and talk. 
43,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762c1d,snappyHippo,2020-04-23T18:57:33.073Z,It is hard to learn a language but it sounds as if the entire family has been here for many years.
43,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762c1d,snappyHippo,2020-04-23T18:58:06.907Z,perhaps there is another family member who could help with translations.
43,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7636cd,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T18:58:37.997Z,im going with not the asshole.  But the husband does need to have his feelings respected and acknowledged 
43,2,5ea1d700de5d74641b671ed0,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-23T18:58:56.273Z,yea what we feeling guys
43,2,5ea1d700de5d74641b671ed0,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-23T18:59:00.300Z,i say no asshole
43,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7627c6,littleHorse,2020-04-23T18:59:11.338Z,Leaning towards not the asshole
43,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762c1d,snappyHippo,2020-04-23T18:59:21.878Z,I guess no but a new plan has to be made to help the mother.
43,2,5ea1d700de5d74641b671ed0,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-23T18:59:28.528Z,Facts
43,2,5ea1d700de5d74641b671ed0,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-23T18:59:34.477Z,but lowkey esl classes is good
43,2,5ea1d700de5d74641b671ed0,culturedSquirrel,2020-04-23T18:59:55.404Z,like she acts like she is the only immigrant who doesnt know english in america. so many people come over and learn english
43,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7636cd,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T19:00:09.006Z,or help the mother in law find a friend or companion to help out with everyday issues in translation 
44,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629ad,smallHorse,2020-04-23T18:41:25.598Z,I don't think the writer is an asshole
44,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762779,newHippo,2020-04-23T18:41:42.915Z,My initial impression is he is indeed the ass hole.  Just because one person can learn multiple languages does not mean everyone can with that kind of ease.  Also clearly she is older and we should be respecting our elders. 
44,1,5ea1c742de5d74641b670c40,newMonkey,2020-04-23T18:41:44.135Z,I understand how this could become very annoying. I think he did the right thing. He even offered sources and to help.
44,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629ad,smallHorse,2020-04-23T18:41:55.176Z,If his life is being consumed by having to translate all the time then he has a right to make that request
44,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637a0,youngSquirrel,2020-04-23T18:42:01.095Z,This guy should have understood the family dynamic when he married in. It is obvious the family takes the position of taking care of the MIL.
44,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762653,conventionalGoat,2020-04-23T18:42:06.185Z,My thoughts are that he was not the asshole. I thought that he was just frustrated. It seems he has been helping her for a while. Its a shame everyone is mad at him. 
44,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762779,newHippo,2020-04-23T18:42:10.846Z,"He knew all of these facts when he married his wife, and was accepting of them.  Sure it may be annoying, but we do things we don't necessarily want to for family."
44,1,5ea1c742de5d74641b670c40,newMonkey,2020-04-23T18:42:19.580Z,isn't helping her to learn a way of taking care of her?
44,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762779,newHippo,2020-04-23T18:42:20.476Z,He lashed out in frustration and that makes him the asshole.
44,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637a0,youngSquirrel,2020-04-23T18:42:49.553Z,Not everyone is good at languages. The older you get the harder it is.
44,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7628db,snappyBear,2020-04-23T18:42:50.889Z,"I'm having trouble deciding, but I'm feeling like he is a bit of an asshole for simply making his mother-in-law feel lesser, even if his intentions were good."
44,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762779,newHippo,2020-04-23T18:42:50.969Z,"Proposing it slowly over time in a calm, and respectful manner with the support of his wife, since it is her family would have potentially solved the issue."
44,1,5ea1c742de5d74641b670c40,newMonkey,2020-04-23T18:43:26.230Z,but isn't 8 years long enough to at least learn basic English
44,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762653,conventionalGoat,2020-04-23T18:43:50.088Z,Maybe he did lash out. I can see where that would hurt his mother-in-law. 
44,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629ad,smallHorse,2020-04-23T18:44:00.610Z,"Personally I wouldn't want to have to ask someone to take me everywhere, I think she enjoys being catered to"
44,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637a0,youngSquirrel,2020-04-23T18:44:04.383Z,Not if that was never the intention. He is projecting his desires.
44,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762653,conventionalGoat,2020-04-23T18:44:06.518Z,"Also, we all sometimes need help from family. "
44,1,5ea1c742de5d74641b670c40,newMonkey,2020-04-23T18:44:16.694Z,he even said he was respectful when telling her
44,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7628db,snappyBear,2020-04-23T18:44:18.484Z,I don't really think that it was the author's place to tell this to his mother in law. Let it come from someone she would relate to better so it doesn't sound so biased.
44,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629ad,smallHorse,2020-04-23T18:44:36.690Z,"I see what you are saying, but if it's not his place to tell her, why is it his place to babysit her?"
44,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637a0,youngSquirrel,2020-04-23T18:44:45.850Z,"By his language, I doubt he is respectful IRL."
44,1,5ea1c742de5d74641b670c40,newMonkey,2020-04-23T18:44:47.502Z,exactly
44,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762779,newHippo,2020-04-23T18:45:02.851Z,As the only white person in the scenario it does come off as entitled and like he expected everyone to assimilate 
44,1,5ea1c742de5d74641b670c40,newMonkey,2020-04-23T18:45:06.314Z,possibly but maybe he was venting
44,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7628db,snappyBear,2020-04-23T18:45:10.111Z,I think he could have chosen a better way to ask her to stop calling on him all the time and to be more self-sufficient
44,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629ad,smallHorse,2020-04-23T18:45:20.779Z,"That would be my only question, was he REALLY respectful in person, because in the text he did sound like an asshole."
44,1,5ea1c742de5d74641b670c40,newMonkey,2020-04-23T18:45:28.067Z,true
44,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7637a0,youngSquirrel,2020-04-23T18:45:46.251Z,There is a cultural aspect here that I think he is missing.
44,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7628db,snappyBear,2020-04-23T18:45:53.009Z,"I agree that from the way the post was written, it's hard to imagine the conversation being too polite and sensitive."
44,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762653,conventionalGoat,2020-04-23T18:46:05.624Z,Ok. I guess he's the asshole. 
44,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629ad,smallHorse,2020-04-23T18:46:09.636Z,"It could be that to, I think Latino people are more family oriented"
44,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762779,newHippo,2020-04-23T18:46:26.776Z,The way he mentioned learning the language of the country then acknowledging we don't have an official language makes me feel he was disrespectful
44,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7629ad,smallSquirrel,2020-04-23T19:11:09.149Z,This one could really go both ways
44,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762779,littleWolf,2020-04-23T19:11:10.543Z,"I think no one is the ass hole.  I think this boils down to cultural differences.  Latinx families are very interwoven and tight knit, and do everything and anything for each other."
44,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7637a0,niceHorse,2020-04-23T19:11:26.788Z,"The family established their dynamic long before this husband came around, he knew what it was when he married in."
44,3,5ea1c742de5d74641b670c40,spryPig,2020-04-23T19:11:29.882Z,"My initial impression is that it could go both ways, I get both sides. "
44,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762779,littleWolf,2020-04-23T19:11:46.302Z,"So one husband who was raised in the culture and one who was not, have differences of opinions in this and differences in how they were raised."
44,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7629ad,smallSquirrel,2020-04-23T19:11:48.765Z,"I think she should understand that it's not his responsibility, and shouldn't expect him to do it. That being said he knew what he was marrying in to."
44,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7628db,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T19:11:51.751Z,This one's tough; I in a way I feel like the husband and wife are both a in the wrong and both in the right in different ways.
44,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762653,conventionalBison,2020-04-23T19:11:54.250Z,They make fun of him but expect him to translate for them. He's the AH
44,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762653,conventionalBison,2020-04-23T19:12:21.850Z,No. I mean she is.. ...
44,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7637a0,niceHorse,2020-04-23T19:12:25.944Z,"There should be ground rules of when he can help. But since wife works more than him, he should help."
44,3,5ea1c742de5d74641b670c40,spryPig,2020-04-23T19:12:28.549Z,why should he translate though if they make fun of him
44,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762779,littleWolf,2020-04-23T19:12:29.085Z,I feel like there just needs to be an open and honest conversation between the couple about what is expected.
44,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7629ad,smallSquirrel,2020-04-23T19:12:31.478Z,"Yeah that is true, she did say they make fun of him a lot."
44,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7628db,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T19:12:37.416Z,I agree it boils down to cultural differences in a lot of ways. And probably some generational differences too.
44,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7629ad,smallSquirrel,2020-04-23T19:13:09.871Z,I think she's an asshole for not having the conversation with her husband and her mother and instead posting about it on the internet.
44,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762653,conventionalBison,2020-04-23T19:13:12.109Z,It also seems like he is telling her that he is frustrtrated and had enough. She is minimizing his concerns. 
44,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7628db,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T19:13:12.674Z,Moving toward resolution rather than placing blame would probably be the better move.
44,3,5ea1c742de5d74641b670c40,spryPig,2020-04-23T19:13:42.042Z,she should have asked him if he minded in the first place
44,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7629ad,smallSquirrel,2020-04-23T19:14:04.920Z,"Kudos to her for getting her master's an being busy, but that doesn't make her mother his responsibility. I'm sure he's got a life too."
44,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762653,conventionalBison,2020-04-23T19:14:21.671Z,I hate it when other people tell me what I have time for....
44,3,5ea1c742de5d74641b670c40,spryPig,2020-04-23T19:14:27.945Z,me too
44,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7637a0,niceHorse,2020-04-23T19:14:49.190Z,"of course, compromise is marriage, so there should be boundaries and communication. But much of that was before marriage stuff. He's in it now."
44,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762779,littleWolf,2020-04-23T19:14:50.875Z,I feel like no one is the ass hole though I feel like it was a miscommunication in expectations
44,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762653,conventionalBison,2020-04-23T19:15:17.048Z,I feel bad for the guy and I almost never feel bad for the guy.
44,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7628db,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T19:15:20.970Z,"But now that it's boiling over, I'm inclined to say both are being assholes if they can't find a solution/compromise."
44,3,5ea1c742de5d74641b670c40,spryPig,2020-04-23T19:15:51.393Z,she shouldn't make fun if him and expect him to do the thing they make fun of him foir
44,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7637a0,niceHorse,2020-04-23T19:16:07.940Z,"Since the family took it on themselves to take care of the mother, it isn't fair for the husband to come in and expect them to all change."
44,3,5ea1c742de5d74641b670c40,spryPig,2020-04-23T19:16:52.605Z,She shouldn't expect his help with something hes made fun of for.
44,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7629ad,smallSquirrel,2020-04-23T19:17:02.573Z,"I see what you are saying, but if they all take care of the mother and were doing it before he came along, why is it now all on his shoulders?"
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7627ba,youngCow,2020-04-23T18:33:27.462Z,I do not think this man is the asshole. I think he is being taking advantage of in a situation where the mom and family could have helped themselves instead of relying on others around them. 
45,0,5e9f4f9e9dc0406f8987a4fe,littlePanda,2020-04-23T18:33:34.624Z,I feel like there is a cultural component in play. The fact that the mother in law was calling him actually seems like he is accepted/respected in the family.
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762a28,youngPig,2020-04-23T18:33:55.477Z,"thought he was the asshole until I read the edit. I think the racism, trump supporter comments have nothing to do with anything. Probably be best to offer other ways to translate like their phone. This would take the burden off him."
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7628c8,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T18:34:01.132Z,"I really consider this guy to be the asshole in this situation. I understand that he has a good mind for learning languages and I understand that having to act like a translator may be uncomfortable, but ultimately he could have expressed"
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7628c8,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T18:34:07.703Z,Himself in a healthy way
45,0,5e9f4f9e9dc0406f8987a4fe,littlePanda,2020-04-23T18:34:20.117Z,I think he could of handled it better.
45,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762719,spryRhino,2020-04-23T18:34:20.745Z,I don't think this person is wrong for wanting to help his mother in law. He made a strong case for why she needs to learn english. I feel like the family jumped to conclusions  about his motives.
45,0,5d482ea721c9be351f76306b,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-23T18:34:24.987Z,"This guy is an asshole. His writing was very combative, so even though he said he was polite when talking to her, the way he described it came across as angry and mean"
45,0,5e9f4f9e9dc0406f8987a4fe,littlePanda,2020-04-23T18:34:56.526Z,"I agree and honestly if he is busy, then just don't pick up the phone!"
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762a28,youngPig,2020-04-23T18:34:58.202Z,"well he is angry, hes sick of being on call as a translator"
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7627ba,youngCow,2020-04-23T18:35:15.424Z,"I do not think he minds helping and translating, but it’s the fact that it happens now several times a day and has become excessive"
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7629b7,newDonkey,2020-04-23T18:35:26.105Z,I don't blame him
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762a28,youngPig,2020-04-23T18:35:29.485Z,lack of understanding for the other can be extremely frustrating 
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762a28,youngPig,2020-04-23T18:35:41.304Z,from the others*
45,0,5e9f4f9e9dc0406f8987a4fe,littlePanda,2020-04-23T18:35:47.250Z,"So, probably needs better boundries but, don't think he handled it the best way."
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7629b7,newDonkey,2020-04-23T18:35:54.062Z,She should at try to learn some English 
45,0,5d482ea721c9be351f76306b,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-23T18:35:59.158Z,It’s his mother in law. He should be more understanding of her situation. 
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762a28,youngPig,2020-04-23T18:36:21.142Z,"there is middle ground, can show them how to use their smart phone to translate, so he doesnthave to do it ALL the time"
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7629b7,newDonkey,2020-04-23T18:36:22.948Z,He should help her learn 
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7627ba,youngCow,2020-04-23T18:36:31.324Z,He may not have handled it the best but I can understand the frustration that builds up over time
45,0,5d482ea721c9be351f76306b,conventionalRabbit,2020-04-23T18:36:37.790Z,Why not enroll the whole family in a class? Or if they have a young kid maybe they can learn to read together
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762a28,youngPig,2020-04-23T18:36:45.846Z,"he offered to help them learn, they dont want to take the time"
45,0,5e9f4f9e9dc0406f8987a4fe,littlePanda,2020-04-23T18:36:47.744Z,"In some parts of CA, Spanish is practically the other accepted language. I can see how you may be able to get by without learning over the 8 years"
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762a28,youngPig,2020-04-23T18:36:57.334Z,which is fine they dont need to its not a requirment
45,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762719,spryRhino,2020-04-23T18:36:58.647Z,All members of the family need to come to an understanding and also try to figure out why he seems to be the one left to be an interpreter. 
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7628c8,conventionalSquirrel,2020-04-23T18:37:13.657Z,I’m sure she has tried to learn some English. Americans are very derogatory in general to people with less than perfect English. I’m sure it’s intimidating to be met with meanness when she tries to use English
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762a28,youngPig,2020-04-23T18:37:18.204Z,but that is their choice and they have to live with that choice. he should have a say on his own involvement though
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7629b7,newDonkey,2020-04-23T18:37:27.169Z,"Yeah,  I would be frustrated to if I had to be called on to  constantly translate "

45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7627ba,youngCow,2020-04-23T18:38:05.652Z,I don’t think this man hates having to translate but maybe wants it to be less frequent through out the day. 
45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7629b7,newDonkey,2020-04-23T18:38:05.707Z,"No, i"

45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7627ba,youngCow,2020-04-23T18:38:34.407Z,He didn’t convey it in such a way though

45,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762a28,youngPig,2020-04-23T18:38:46.356Z,the edit explained he was nicer about it

45,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76306b,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T18:50:04.167Z,He is her partner and learned Spanish so he could communicate with her family…
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7628c8,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T18:50:09.945Z,"It depends on his reasoning for being mad. If he’s mad for her volunteering him, she might be the asshole. If he’s mad because the mom should learn English, he’s the asshole."
45,1,5e9f4f9e9dc0406f8987a4fe,likelyWolf,2020-04-23T18:50:22.854Z,Agree
45,1,5e9f4f9e9dc0406f8987a4fe,likelyWolf,2020-04-23T18:50:33.925Z,"So, which one is it though?"
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629b7,niceLion,2020-04-23T18:50:39.182Z,He shouldn't have to spend every min of his life translating for her mother 
45,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762719,newPig,2020-04-23T18:50:42.931Z,"The husband is the partner, but he is not the fall guy. She should have asked him if he would be fine with helping her mother."
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a28,spryGoat,2020-04-23T18:50:47.133Z,"in this case, she is, for volunteering him without asking"
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76297b,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:51:00.215Z,they should learn english. some european countries require to speak the native language fluently for citizenship
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a28,spryGoat,2020-04-23T18:51:14.850Z,they could use phone translator
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a28,spryGoat,2020-04-23T18:51:30.169Z,not even sure how this is a big deal at this point but its the scenerio
45,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76306b,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T18:51:32.346Z,We don’t know if she asked him or not
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76297b,smallOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:51:41.944Z,"thats true too, i didnt think of translation apps"
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7627ba,spryBear,2020-04-23T18:51:42.159Z,I don’t think they necessarily need to learn English but there’s certainly lots of translator apps available that are easy to use. He could help her learn
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629b7,niceLion,2020-04-23T18:51:42.940Z,Shes selfish and doesn't consider how he feels  being joined at the hip with her mother as her personal translator 
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7628c8,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T18:51:44.775Z,"If he has enough time to answer the phone, he can do it. If he doesn’t want to he can just not answer the phone. Or he could set a boundary like no more than 3 times a week."
45,1,5e9f4f9e9dc0406f8987a4fe,likelyWolf,2020-04-23T18:51:46.244Z,"there is a tinge of white privelege in his stance, though..."
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a28,spryGoat,2020-04-23T18:51:53.550Z,"she didnt, she volunteered his time without askign according to the scenerio if i rmeember correctly"
45,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76306b,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T18:51:57.676Z,Passing something along implies she told him about it first
45,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762719,newPig,2020-04-23T18:52:19.491Z,"After 8 years, I don't think the mother in law cares to learn English. "
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629b7,niceLion,2020-04-23T18:52:23.413Z,She shouldn't have volunteered him for the job without asking 
45,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76306b,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T18:52:31.980Z,She dodmt
45,1,5e9f4f9e9dc0406f8987a4fe,likelyWolf,2020-04-23T18:52:32.049Z,"Different mother in law, isn't it?"
45,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76306b,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T18:52:39.450Z,Didn’t
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7628c8,likelySquirrel,2020-04-23T18:52:51.484Z,"Maybe something he said made the wife think it was ok. Also, she implies that originally the mother asked her first and the mother chose to start calling the husband directly "
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a28,spryGoat,2020-04-23T18:53:09.968Z,she gave him the phone because she was busy
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a28,spryGoat,2020-04-23T18:53:21.165Z,it became a daily thing
45,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76306b,snappyMonkey,2020-04-23T18:53:32.009Z,An occasional thing
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629b7,niceLion,2020-04-23T18:53:43.009Z,8 years is a long time to be in  the US and not know a lick of English 
45,1,5e9f4f9e9dc0406f8987a4fe,likelyWolf,2020-04-23T18:53:46.419Z,"Yeah, pretty sure it said occasionally"
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7627ba,spryBear,2020-04-23T18:53:51.395Z,"Occasionally I wouldn’t mind but if it’s daily, it would irritate me"
45,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a28,spryGoat,2020-04-23T18:53:56.663Z,"was occasional, then they called him directly"
45,1,5e9f4f9e9dc0406f8987a4fe,likelyWolf,2020-04-23T18:54:06.189Z,Where is the 8 years coming from? Wasn't that the last one?
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762976,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:38:13.755Z,Does anyone else think this person was the asshole?
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76273d,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-23T18:38:20.200Z,"I think the fact that the poster mentioned they asked politely which is a factor, so I don't think they're an asshole"
46,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cb,youngHippo,2020-04-23T18:38:32.623Z,"Yea this person is an asshole. You're in America. It's freedom of speech, whether you wanna speak English or not."
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762868,culturedHorse,2020-04-23T18:38:45.415Z,I thought the son in law was actually insensitive to her not understanding French
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76273d,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-23T18:38:52.696Z,Agreed
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762976,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:38:58.679Z,"Maybe, but if they wanted to speak English and include her they could have. Not everyone has to be part of every conversation. "
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762881,youngLion,2020-04-23T18:39:02.087Z,"I personally think the person is an asshole, just because she doesn't understand doesn't mean she is entitled to know what they are talking about"
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76287b,smallRhino,2020-04-23T18:39:10.938Z,They are free to speak what they want.
46,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cb,youngHippo,2020-04-23T18:39:13.117Z,The person probably feels most comfortable speaking French. Now they feel super uncomfortable for speaking what they know best.
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76273d,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-23T18:39:15.008Z,I think because it's a son it makes it ruder to speak a language the poster doesn't understand.
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76273d,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-23T18:39:26.477Z,They can go to a private space to speak if they want to speak privately.
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762881,youngLion,2020-04-23T18:39:36.658Z,I speak to my wife and there are alot of things that I don't want my parents to know 
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76273d,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-23T18:39:40.839Z,True
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762868,culturedHorse,2020-04-23T18:39:43.070Z,"If you are speaking in front of another person and in their home as guests, it’s pretty much standard that you don’t exclude your host."
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762976,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:39:55.584Z,But what if they were there before and she sat down? 
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762868,culturedHorse,2020-04-23T18:40:18.301Z," Agree that she should not be privy to all their conversations but in front of her, yes"
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762881,youngLion,2020-04-23T18:40:23.659Z,I don't think the son is a guest in a home that is owned by his parent
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76273d,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-23T18:40:26.476Z,Let's all think about how we would feel if our parents/children/family did this while staying at our house... I would be upset too.
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7627ce,culturedBear,2020-04-23T18:40:39.558Z,Yeah he's an asshole. I Especially as guests in her home they should include her in all public conversations
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bbf,newGoat,2020-04-23T18:40:39.787Z,I do not think that this person was wrong at all. She does not understand the language in which they are speaking but they do speak and understand the language she is familiar with. 
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762976,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:40:40.580Z,"Was she trying to have a conversation with them as well? If she's on her phone and otherwise disinterested, I don't see a problem in having a conversation in their own language."
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762868,culturedHorse,2020-04-23T18:40:42.266Z,I would definitely feel hurt
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7627ce,culturedBear,2020-04-23T18:40:57.164Z,As would i
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76287b,smallRhino,2020-04-23T18:41:00.615Z,I wouldn't be upset unless they were talking bad about me in the other language haha.
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762868,culturedHorse,2020-04-23T18:41:02.087Z,But it is not the sons native language
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bbf,newGoat,2020-04-23T18:41:21.571Z,"Also, if the son has something to say to his spouse that he doesn't want his in law to hear than he should say it in private, not another language. "
46,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cb,youngHippo,2020-04-23T18:41:21.663Z,She didn't have to say it was disrespectful. That's not a good word to tell someone. Just say you don't understand what's going on and would follow the conversation better if it was in English.
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762976,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:41:22.565Z,"They are not guests. They are visiting family. When you visit family, do you act formal 100% of the time or do you chill and relax?"
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76273d,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-23T18:41:31.916Z,I act formal.... 
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762881,youngLion,2020-04-23T18:41:33.341Z,"She doesn't need to feel like she is entitle to anything from her kids, just because you have them as a guest doesn't mean you need to give them a 1to1 play by play of what you are saying"
46,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cb,youngHippo,2020-04-23T18:41:57.474Z,But yea it is her house and she has every right to act like a Karen.
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7627ce,culturedBear,2020-04-23T18:42:04.517Z,It could be a matter of embatassment as weel
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762881,youngLion,2020-04-23T18:42:06.548Z,"We assume that we are all perfect, but in reality we all do this, even if it is unintentional "
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762868,culturedHorse,2020-04-23T18:42:08.881Z, I if my children are in our home they know the rules of etiquette 
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76273d,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-23T18:42:13.122Z,So what do we all think? Asshole or not?
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bbf,newGoat,2020-04-23T18:42:17.289Z,"Yes, but it is rude to exclude someone in the same room from an open conversation. "
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762881,youngLion,2020-04-23T18:42:18.612Z,Asshole
46,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cb,youngHippo,2020-04-23T18:42:19.169Z,I vote asshole
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762976,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:42:19.761Z,I still think asshole.

46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bbf,newGoat,2020-04-23T18:42:46.543Z,"I'm sorry but I don't think she is an asshole, I think they are being insensitive to her. "
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76273d,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-23T18:42:58.241Z,4 asshole/3 not; so majority vote for asshole?
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762bbf,newGoat,2020-04-23T18:43:09.560Z,I would be hurt if my daughter did this. 
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762868,culturedHorse,2020-04-23T18:43:15.438Z,I wonder if the tables were reversed if the husband would have been offended
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762976,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:43:27.770Z,I think that is the best because we want to come to a consensus. 
46,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cb,youngHippo,2020-04-23T18:43:40.585Z,Maybe she would prefer Spanish?
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762881,youngLion,2020-04-23T18:43:40.847Z,Majority holds that she is an asshole
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76273d,conventionalGorilla,2020-04-23T18:44:08.731Z,Agreed
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762868,culturedHorse,2020-04-23T18:44:12.721Z,Fine
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76287b,smallRhino,2020-04-23T18:44:21.672Z,I agree with going with the majority as well
46,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762881,youngLion,2020-04-23T18:44:26.660Z,who is the hold out?
46,2,5d482ea621c9be351f76273d,newHorse,2020-04-23T19:07:56.065Z,I don't believe that the person is an asshole because she is just trying to be considerate to her husband.
46,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762881,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-23T19:07:59.475Z,I think the mom is the asshole and the guy isn't
46,2,5d482ea621c9be351f76273d,newHorse,2020-04-23T19:08:03.152Z,Agreed.

46,2,5d482ea621c9be351f76273d,newHorse,2020-04-23T19:08:29.571Z,I think because the husband doesn't comfortably speak the language that the person is just trying to make the best of being between a rock and a hard place.
46,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7627ce,likelyHippo,2020-04-23T19:08:32.310Z,The writer created afalsechoice forhimself. It wasn't either or

46,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762881,culturedOrangutan,2020-04-23T19:08:47.082Z,he is looking at both sides and think that the mom would be understanding and accomidating to her son in law
46,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762868,littleBison,2020-04-23T19:08:59.185Z,  agreed 
46,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cb,smallDonkey,2020-04-23T19:09:12.770Z,I think she's an asshole because she is a guest.  She should include her mom in the conversation cause she never gets to see her.
46,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7627ce,likelyHippo,2020-04-23T19:09:22.557Z,He's the asshole fornot explaining  before hand tomom
46,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cb,smallDonkey,2020-04-23T19:09:24.162Z,Her husband will understand. Obviously her mom doesn't. But that's alright.
46,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762868,littleBison,2020-04-23T19:09:29.963Z,On the other hand are just there for the weekend so maybe they could accommodate her but you are right they are 
46,2,5d482ea621c9be351f76273d,newHorse,2020-04-23T19:09:30.881Z,I think they could have explained to the mom a little better why they are choosing to speak German mostly.

47,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762cb3,conventionalLion,2020-04-23T18:57:33.172Z,My initial reaction is the wife is dumping her parents off on her husband to solve their problems.
47,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a97,smallGiraffe,2020-04-23T18:57:50.342Z,I think it's unreasonable for the person to ask her husband to help out all of the time. I understand occasionally but constantly is too much. 
47,1,5ea0d2929dc0406f89889f9f,niceBison,2020-04-23T18:57:57.561Z,I think that she is an asshole because she should be willing to help some of the time. She should figure out something for her parents when they need help translating. 
47,1,5ea0d2929dc0406f89889f9f,niceBison,2020-04-23T18:58:13.433Z,She could have asked one of her siblings to step up and help.
47,1,5ea12e4ade5d74641b66be98,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:58:17.594Z,"I agree with the husband, that the wife's parents *should* have learned English.  Yes, you immigrated, and it's hard, but the parents are assholes too for burdening the wife and now the husband."
47,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7628ce,smallGoat,2020-04-23T18:58:26.717Z,I was thinking since the wife is working full time and doing her Masters she has her  hands full and asking the husband to help her parents isnt that big a deal since they are married
47,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762911,newBear,2020-04-23T18:58:33.399Z,Her being TA depends on how often her husband is having to do this and how long they have been in the country. If it has been a while then yes she is being TA.
47,1,5ea12e4ade5d74641b66be98,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-23T18:58:47.278Z,"Once in a while is ok, but expecting it all the time whenever they call?  I don't think so."

47,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7628ce,smallGoat,2020-04-23T19:00:19.923Z,Agreed that it sounds like he is burnt out on helping her parents and that they should take iniitiatve to try and learn English

47,1,5ea0d2929dc0406f89889f9f,niceBison,2020-04-23T19:00:50.224Z,She is being a TA saying her parents shouldn't have to learn English.
47,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a97,smallGiraffe,2020-04-23T19:00:59.122Z,Exactly conventionalOrangutan

47,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7628ce,smallGoat,2020-04-23T19:01:10.264Z,Older people can be set in their ways

47,1,5ea12e4ade5d74641b66be98,conventionalOrangutan,2020-04-23T19:01:48.841Z,"I don't think she has a case.  We all agree that once in a while helping out is cool, and it seems like the husband is already doing that.  Doesn't matter if older people are set in their ways, they're still being assholes."
47,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7628ce,smallGoat,2020-04-23T19:02:16.289Z,It sounds like she is ambitious and that she has had a tough life and she's using her husbnd as a lifeline because she is overloaded
47,3,5ea12e4ade5d74641b66be98,niceMonkey,2020-04-23T19:27:06.505Z,The person in question is not an asshole.  It is not his responsibility to act as a translator for the family.
47,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762a97,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T19:27:18.964Z,I don't think he's an asshole. I think his feelings are completely valid and to the point where hes just being used and is their crutch.
47,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762cb3,youngBison,2020-04-23T19:27:37.916Z,My initial impression is the husband did a poor job of explaining why he didn't want to do this. the way he said it makes him look like an asshole.
47,3,5ea12e4ade5d74641b66be98,niceMonkey,2020-04-23T19:27:42.443Z,"In addition, he provided a bunch of resources so that the parents could become independent."
47,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7628ce,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-23T19:28:00.387Z,His attitude/tone in the post was totally disrespectful toward her parents
47,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762911,likelyGiraffe,2020-04-23T19:28:12.915Z,I don't think he's TA. He can't be there all the time for them.

47,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762cb3,youngBison,2020-04-23T19:28:24.184Z,"If he had been more polite in his explanation, I would agree with him. However, he had a meltdown and looks like an ass."
47,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762a97,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T19:28:43.061Z,You would have a meltdown too if you were pushed to your breaking point
47,3,5ea0d2929dc0406f89889f9f,littlePanda,2020-04-23T19:28:45.724Z,I think he was frustrated when he wrote the post. He explained at the bottom that he talked to her in a respectful manner.
47,3,5ea12e4ade5d74641b66be98,niceMonkey,2020-04-23T19:29:00.198Z,"his TLDR clarified that his tone was respectful to the parents.  It was his write up that wasn't respectful, and I agree with you guys on that aspect."

47,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762cb3,youngBison,2020-04-23T19:29:41.220Z,in bringing this up.

47,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7628ce,likelyOrangutan,2020-04-23T19:29:54.331Z,The parents may not have as strong an appitude to learn another language as he himself does - thats a limitation of the parents and maybe he needs to understand their limitations or what they feel comfortable doing.
47,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762a97,culturedRhino,2020-04-23T19:30:33.037Z,He doesn't feel comfortable continuing to be their translator either and they need to understand that as well
47,3,5ea12e4ade5d74641b66be98,niceMonkey,2020-04-23T19:30:34.977Z,"The main point is that he shouldn't be expected to be a translator, and he has provided tools so that the parents could learn.  If you decide to move to, say, Germany, it's your prerogative to learn German."
47,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762cb3,youngBison,2020-04-23T19:30:50.623Z,""" I told her I'm sick of dealing with her shit because she can't speak english"" - that's not being polite. "

47,3,5ea0d2929dc0406f89889f9f,littlePanda,2020-04-23T19:31:13.663Z,I think he was more saying what he wanted to say to her in his head. He didn't actually tell her that. I think he let his frustration out in the post.

48,0,5ea1d246de5d74641b67178a,eagerBear,2020-04-27T15:58:02.426Z,Exactly. She simply wanted to be eavesdropping 24/7.

48,0,5ea6f6e0002f966295b20011,livelyDolphin,2020-04-27T15:58:48.875Z,Right. There's no way that he'd even have a regular conversation with her because they don't speak the same language. She can't even be included though her nosey ass wants it
48,0,5ea6f884002f966295b20062,brightHorse,2020-04-27T15:58:49.648Z,I understand that she might want to participate in a conversation with her son and his partner but I think the way she went about it was probably not the best.
48,0,5ea1d246de5d74641b67178a,eagerBear,2020-04-27T15:58:52.655Z,"She came across as a busybody and nosey. I don't know if there are racist undertones in that particular example, but it is certainly rude of her to assume she's automatically privy to everyone else's conversation."
48,0,5ea1d61ade5d74641b671d85,lightMonkey,2020-04-27T15:59:10.455Z,"Furthermore, it struck me as a red flag that she first called her son's husband his ""partner"" and only later clarified that they're married."
48,0,5ea6f6e0002f966295b20011,livelyDolphin,2020-04-27T15:59:20.785Z,I just assume if you're a nationalist you're a racist
48,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bda,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-27T15:59:26.267Z,This person is an asshole and nosey. Its her sons relationship and she needs to respect it.
48,0,5ea6f4d8002f966295b1fff4,openCamel,2020-04-27T15:59:36.201Z,"Yeah true, she seemed uncomfortable about the relationship as well."
48,0,5ea6f6e0002f966295b20011,livelyDolphin,2020-04-27T16:00:16.513Z,"Yes helperbot, both sides were considered. Ones living his life and the other is nosey"
48,0,5ea6f820002f966295b20060,delightedOtter,2020-04-27T16:00:40.065Z,I think this person is the asshole. She should be more considerate of the other person. This other language is the language he is best able to communicate in. The person should be more understanding and attempt to converse with the other.
48,0,5ea1d61ade5d74641b671d85,lightMonkey,2020-04-27T16:00:47.291Z,"Yes, I can see how she wants to be in on the conversation, but...too bad? Maybe she should learn French and also learn to respect others more."
48,0,5ea1d246de5d74641b67178a,eagerBear,2020-04-27T16:00:57.811Z,"If we had to consider both sides, I can see how it can feel a little isolating to be next to two people involved in a conversation you have no access to. That happens to me and my husband's family."
48,0,5ea1d246de5d74641b67178a,eagerBear,2020-04-27T16:01:19.959Z,"Only in the sense that she isn't able to even ""jump in"" and contribute if she had something relevant to add."
48,0,5ea1d246de5d74641b67178a,eagerBear,2020-04-27T16:01:26.383Z,But maybe she should also learn some French. Just saying.
48,0,5ea6f6e0002f966295b20011,livelyDolphin,2020-04-27T16:01:27.540Z,It's only an american thing to speak only one language anyhow. Shes on the wrong side of history
48,0,5ea1d246de5d74641b67178a,eagerBear,2020-04-27T16:02:12.428Z,We are all in agreement?

48,0,5ea6f820002f966295b20060,delightedOtter,2020-04-27T16:02:23.884Z,Yes I agree
48,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bda,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-27T16:02:35.030Z,"Yes, this person is an asshole."
48,0,5ea1d61ade5d74641b671d85,lightMonkey,2020-04-27T16:02:35.401Z,I think we all say to OP: YTA!

48,0,5ea6f6e0002f966295b20011,livelyDolphin,2020-04-27T16:03:00.440Z,1. Yes she is an asshole 2. She is very nosey 3. She needs to learn french 
48,0,5ea6f6e0002f966295b20011,livelyDolphin,2020-04-27T16:03:06.888Z,I agree on the poll
48,1,5ea6f884002f966295b20062,inspiredMonkey,2020-04-27T16:11:57.959Z,I do not think they're an asshole. They were trying to accommodate their husband.
48,1,5ea1d246de5d74641b67178a,novelOtter,2020-04-27T16:12:09.487Z,"I was torn on this one. I voted that the son wasn't the asshole, but I think he could have thought of better ways to include his mother."
48,1,5ea6f4d8002f966295b1fff4,delightedHippo,2020-04-27T16:12:16.760Z,"I don't think this person's the asshole. It sounds like their husband can barely communicate in English, and it said they spoke ""mostly German"", which implies they had spoken in English a fair amount as well."
48,1,5ea6f820002f966295b20060,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-04-27T16:13:00.996Z,"I think the son is the asshole, as he should have included the mother since it was at her house they were staying at. Just an attempt to link both conversations, through body language. Even drawing pictures may help. "
48,1,5ea1d61ade5d74641b671d85,fulfilledBear,2020-04-27T16:13:06.662Z,"I do not the OP is the asshole but I don't quite think the mom is being the asshole, either, unless she actually called her own kid an asshole. I think it's just a tough/awkward situation and the OP is trying to make it work."
48,1,5ea1d246de5d74641b67178a,novelOtter,2020-04-27T16:13:10.252Z,"The ""mostly"" is a good catch. I think the son could have also repeated important parts of the conversation in English after using German. That would have been beneficial for his mom and for the the husband as well."
48,1,5ea6f884002f966295b20062,inspiredMonkey,2020-04-27T16:13:27.146Z,I think the poster was trying to think of both parties but found it difficult to find ways to incorporate his mom.
48,1,5ea6f6e0002f966295b20011,brightDolphin,2020-04-27T16:13:45.397Z,I did not find the op to be an asshole. He husband is just very nervous to be in a new place with his inlaws. I can understand being nervous around your inlaws. 
48,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bda,livelyHorse,2020-04-27T16:13:48.044Z,"I don't think the person is an asshole, the husband is not comfortable with English, not because he doesn't want to but because he struggles."
48,1,5ea6f6e0002f966295b20011,brightDolphin,2020-04-27T16:14:02.216Z,"The mother got angry about it which makes her the asshole. It's okay to say that you miss your son and would like to have some more conversations, it's another thing to get angry that your son is supporting his husband. "
48,1,5ea6f6e0002f966295b20011,brightDolphin,2020-04-27T16:14:09.112Z,"the mother is already in a comfortable place, her house, the husband is not so his feelings come first"
48,1,5ea6f820002f966295b20060,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-04-27T16:14:25.840Z,That is a good point
48,1,5ea1d246de5d74641b67178a,novelOtter,2020-04-27T16:14:39.673Z,"Agreed. The son's not an asshole, but he could do more to be inclusive of both parties."
48,1,5ea6f4d8002f966295b1fff4,delightedHippo,2020-04-27T16:14:50.941Z,"I agree with you fulfilledBear I don't think either of them is really an asshole unless the mom came out swinging and called them an asshole lol. If the mom had politely asked to be included, then I don't even see this as a big deal. "
48,1,5ea1d61ade5d74641b671d85,fulfilledBear,2020-04-27T16:15:10.725Z,Agreed with brightDolphin; the OP's mother is not being very compassionate. She surely has chances to talk with her child one on one and catch up that way.
48,1,5ea6f820002f966295b20060,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-04-27T16:15:16.180Z,"After seeing both sides, I now think that the son is not the asshole. He needs to accomodate the guest by making him feel welcome by participating in his native language"
48,1,5ea6f6e0002f966295b20011,brightDolphin,2020-04-27T16:15:21.239Z,The mom said he was a disrepectful asshole
48,1,5ea1d61ade5d74641b671d85,fulfilledBear,2020-04-27T16:15:27.976Z,brigh
48,1,5ea1d61ade5d74641b671d85,fulfilledBear,2020-04-27T16:15:32.822Z,"Whoops, sorry :)"
48,1,5ea6f884002f966295b20062,inspiredMonkey,2020-04-27T16:15:33.925Z,It's a tough situation for both parties.
48,1,5ea1d246de5d74641b67178a,novelOtter,2020-04-27T16:15:48.925Z,We aren't sure whether those are the mom's words or OP putting words in the mom's mouth.
48,1,5ea1d61ade5d74641b671d85,fulfilledBear,2020-04-27T16:15:49.088Z,brightDolphin I know the OP put it that way but I wasn't quite sure whether to take it 100% literally.
48,1,5ea1d61ade5d74641b671d85,fulfilledBear,2020-04-27T16:16:05.248Z,"Exactly, novelOtter"
48,1,5ea6f6e0002f966295b20011,brightDolphin,2020-04-27T16:16:10.906Z,I take everything literally lol
48,1,5ea6f4d8002f966295b1fff4,delightedHippo,2020-04-27T16:16:23.044Z,"If that's the case, the mom is the only one being unreasonable. I think the OP is doing their best but isn't handling it like an expert, but that doesn't make them the asshole."
48,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bda,livelyHorse,2020-04-27T16:16:28.024Z,The mother needs to understand the husband is insecure with his english language.
48,1,5ea1d246de5d74641b67178a,novelOtter,2020-04-27T16:16:47.081Z,I've got some compassion for the mother. I may be in the minority here.
48,1,5ea6f4d8002f966295b1fff4,delightedHippo,2020-04-27T16:17:29.139Z,"I see the mother's side for sure, I just don't think the OP is an ""asshole"" just because they aren't a master mediator. "
48,1,5ea1d246de5d74641b67178a,novelOtter,2020-04-27T16:17:46.232Z,The son has clearly stated that the husband knows English and it seems has a high enough level of fluency but is uncomfortable with it. English is the unifying language amongst all 3. But I still do not think the son's an asshole.
48,1,5ea6f884002f966295b20062,inspiredMonkey,2020-04-27T16:17:46.927Z,I voted no. I don't think the original poster is an asshole because they were trying to accommodate both sides and you can't please everyone.
49,2,5ea6f7b2002f966295b2001f,curiousMonkey,2020-04-27T16:11:30.341Z,I feel like no one is the asshole in this situation. 
49,2,5ea6f7b2002f966295b2001f,curiousMonkey,2020-04-27T16:11:44.270Z,The husband should make more of an effort to speak english to his mother while he lives int he house.

49,2,5ea6f596002f966295b20001,inspiredHippo,2020-04-27T16:12:25.458Z,And he can speak english and his husband will still at least know whats being said
49,2,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightCamel,2020-04-27T16:12:32.368Z,The son is the asshole. His mother doesn't speak German. The son's husband speaks English. All 3 of them have a common language they COULD speak.
49,2,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightCamel,2020-04-27T16:12:37.476Z,She is being excluded

49,2,5ea0dd3c9dc0406f8988bd94,brightElephant,2020-04-27T16:12:56.380Z,I think that the German guy should make an effort to include the mother in conversations if she is in the room
49,2,5ea6f618002f966295b20008,novelHorse,2020-04-27T16:13:07.933Z,I agree with that
49,2,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightCamel,2020-04-27T16:13:15.234Z,Agreed. German between the two of them is fine. English with all 3 is appropriate.

49,2,5ea0dd3c9dc0406f8988bd94,brightElephant,2020-04-27T16:14:11.795Z,The mother probably feels paranoid about what they're talking about.  And possibly insulted that her son's husband doesn't want to include her
49,2,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffc,openGiraffe,2020-04-27T16:14:12.985Z,but he probably doesn't want to be embarrassed in front of his mother-in-law if he is not able to communicate well
49,2,5ea6f618002f966295b20008,novelHorse,2020-04-27T16:14:13.838Z,yeah this is a lack talking between the two if everyone explained the problem there would be no problem
49,2,5ea6f7b2002f966295b2001f,curiousMonkey,2020-04-27T16:14:20.871Z,"Agree, English with the entire group.  What they do in private is not the mother's business. "

49,2,5ea6f618002f966295b20008,novelHorse,2020-04-27T16:14:39.755Z,So we all agree then 
49,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c05,eagerZebra,2020-04-27T16:14:45.544Z,yup
49,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763be9,excitedBear,2020-04-27T16:14:45.737Z,so he would rather exclude the mom-in-law rather than feel a bit embarrassed if he uses the wrong word? he needs to man up.
49,2,5ea0dd3c9dc0406f8988bd94,brightElephant,2020-04-27T16:14:48.935Z,"Besides, how would the German ever get to know his mother in law if he won't talk to her."

49,2,5ea0dd3c9dc0406f8988bd94,brightElephant,2020-04-27T16:15:23.476Z,"Yes, the son is the asshole for not making an effort to accomodate his mother."
49,2,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffc,openGiraffe,2020-04-27T16:15:27.460Z,yes asshole
49,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d2b,livelyGorilla,2020-04-27T16:15:31.710Z,"Yes, he is an asshole."
49,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c05,eagerZebra,2020-04-27T16:15:32.768Z,asshole it is
49,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763be9,excitedBear,2020-04-27T16:15:34.921Z,"It is hard to consider the other side, because there is just no logical reason to exclude his mom from conversations."
49,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763be9,excitedBear,2020-04-27T16:15:41.293Z,"yes, agree that he is the butt."
49,2,5ea0dd3c9dc0406f8988bd94,brightElephant,2020-04-27T16:15:54.903Z,And i agree that the German should take this small group opportunity to learn English better.
49,2,5ea6f596002f966295b20001,inspiredHippo,2020-04-27T16:16:08.911Z,"Right, it would be much easier to explain to the mother the husbands fears then explain why your ignoring her"
49,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763be9,excitedBear,2020-04-27T16:16:24.146Z,I agree.
49,2,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightCamel,2020-04-27T16:16:34.228Z,"He speaks English, his vocabulary just isn't as good as his primary language."
49,2,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightCamel,2020-04-27T16:16:48.378Z,Even people who are fluent rarely have equal vocabularies across all the languages they know.
49,2,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightCamel,2020-04-27T16:16:57.278Z,That is a terrible reason to not want to speak English.
49,2,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffc,openGiraffe,2020-04-27T16:16:59.524Z,The mom should be considerate about this
49,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c05,eagerZebra,2020-04-27T16:17:05.834Z,"He has nothing to be shy about, it's how you learn English"
49,2,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightCamel,2020-04-27T16:17:11.886Z,Yup.
49,2,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightCamel,2020-04-27T16:17:51.809Z,One person hasn't voted.
49,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763be9,excitedBear,2020-04-27T16:18:07.133Z,I voted.
49,2,5ea6f618002f966295b20008,novelHorse,2020-04-27T16:18:07.726Z,yes it is

49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightHippo,2020-04-27T16:26:30.903Z,Not the asshole.
49,3,5ea6f7b2002f966295b2001f,brightOtter,2020-04-27T16:26:36.842Z,Not the asshole.  She is right for asking them to speak English in her home
49,3,5ea6f596002f966295b20001,curiousHorse,2020-04-27T16:26:37.287Z,Oh def not
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c05,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-27T16:26:38.258Z,not the asshome
49,3,5ea0dd3c9dc0406f8988bd94,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-27T16:26:41.960Z,I agree.  She is not the ashole.
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d2b,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-27T16:26:42.979Z,They need to speak English when they are around the mom.
49,3,5ea6f618002f966295b20008,excitedBison,2020-04-27T16:26:43.176Z,i agree with that
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d2b,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-27T16:26:51.047Z,She isn't the asshole.
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffc,openBear,2020-04-27T16:26:56.551Z,"agreed, i think he husband overreacted"
49,3,5ea6f596002f966295b20001,curiousHorse,2020-04-27T16:26:58.909Z,Does anyone even have any reason why she would be the asshole? this seems pretty straight forward
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightHippo,2020-04-27T16:27:06.097Z,Well.. that was a quick consensus lol
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c05,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-27T16:27:06.304Z,I don't understand why is her son not translating
49,3,5ea6f618002f966295b20008,excitedBison,2020-04-27T16:27:10.146Z,if the husband can speak fluent English he should do it around the mother  
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763be9,novelZebra,2020-04-27T16:27:10.663Z,"The mom cannot speak the language, so the other two should speak English in front of her."
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffc,openBear,2020-04-27T16:27:17.504Z,i guess we can say that she made him feel upset or probably embarrassed him?
49,3,5ea0dd3c9dc0406f8988bd94,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-27T16:27:20.103Z,Would it kill the dude to speak English while in the home of a non-French speaker?  Especially if its a mother in law
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffc,openBear,2020-04-27T16:27:30.780Z,but even then i still think it's fair to say that they should speak in english
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightHippo,2020-04-27T16:27:39.934Z,The only way she could have possibly been an asshole is if she was screaming and yelling about it instead of just asking nicely (like she presented it.)
49,3,5ea0dd3c9dc0406f8988bd94,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-27T16:27:46.130Z,And the son doesn't need to translate.  His partner speaks English.
49,3,5ea6f618002f966295b20008,excitedBison,2020-04-27T16:27:47.102Z,The son need to translate at the very least 
49,3,5ea6f618002f966295b20008,excitedBison,2020-04-27T16:27:55.149Z,true
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763be9,novelZebra,2020-04-27T16:28:00.760Z,"He did speak a few sentences in English, and she was able to understand him. Why would either of the men want to exclude the mom from conversation? It is disrespectful."
49,3,5ea0dd3c9dc0406f8988bd94,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-27T16:28:06.385Z,Why bother staying at her home if they're not going to talk to her?
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d2b,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-27T16:28:13.670Z,exactly
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightHippo,2020-04-27T16:28:14.425Z,For a free place to stay
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightHippo,2020-04-27T16:28:20.612Z,clearly.
49,3,5ea6f596002f966295b20001,curiousHorse,2020-04-27T16:28:34.215Z,"Right, and if the mom doesnt seem them often, and they spend lots of time together, it would be nice to focus on her not each other"
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c05,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-27T16:28:35.532Z,"if partner is shy, son can just say it and translate"
49,3,5ea6f618002f966295b20008,excitedBison,2020-04-27T16:28:36.985Z,it might not of been the husbands idea to visit also
49,3,5ea6f618002f966295b20008,excitedBison,2020-04-27T16:28:48.419Z,still rude tho
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763be9,novelZebra,2020-04-27T16:28:49.470Z,And for the husband to go upstairs rather than speak English shows what a butt he is. Just flat out rude. 
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightHippo,2020-04-27T16:28:53.315Z,Are we all in a agreement then that she wasn't an asshole for asking to included in conversation?
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d2b,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-27T16:28:59.307Z,yes
49,3,5ea6f618002f966295b20008,excitedBison,2020-04-27T16:29:00.570Z,yes 
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763be9,novelZebra,2020-04-27T16:29:02.064Z,I am in agreement with that.
49,3,5ea6f7b2002f966295b2001f,brightOtter,2020-04-27T16:29:04.839Z,Yes
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffc,openBear,2020-04-27T16:29:06.385Z,yup
49,3,5ea0dd3c9dc0406f8988bd94,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-27T16:29:13.488Z,"If the partner didn't speak English, then the son should translate.  But, since the partner does speak English, and they're at her home, speak English."
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c05,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-27T16:29:17.603Z,she's not an asshole for sure
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763be9,novelZebra,2020-04-27T16:29:29.933Z,She sure did raise one though.  :-)
49,3,5ea0dd3c9dc0406f8988bd94,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-27T16:29:32.693Z,"Yep, this woman is not an asshole. "
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightHippo,2020-04-27T16:29:45.373Z,The husband apparently speaks a second language with an ACCENT *gasp*
49,3,5ea6f596002f966295b20001,curiousHorse,2020-04-27T16:29:46.712Z,"haha, for sure"
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightHippo,2020-04-27T16:29:47.956Z,the horror
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d2b,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-27T16:29:51.022Z,The woman isn't making unreasonable demands.
49,3,5ea0dd3c9dc0406f8988bd94,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-27T16:29:51.122Z,"Yeah, her son is a bit of an asshole.  The partner is a bigger one."
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightHippo,2020-04-27T16:30:05.846Z,Agreed. Storming off like that was unnecessary for sure.
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c05,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-27T16:30:12.729Z,"I don't know what ""both sides"" are here"
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763be9,novelZebra,2020-04-27T16:30:17.690Z,Same here.
49,3,5ea6f618002f966295b20008,excitedBison,2020-04-27T16:30:19.340Z,as always things just need to be talked about more
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffc,openBear,2020-04-27T16:30:22.248Z,agreed
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffc,openBear,2020-04-27T16:30:30.927Z,there just needed to be an open conversation
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763be9,novelZebra,2020-04-27T16:30:31.506Z,"I am trying to think of the other side in a positive way for when we are asked. but, I just don't see it."
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d2b,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-27T16:30:32.701Z,communication is key!
49,3,5ea0dd3c9dc0406f8988bd94,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-27T16:30:37.588Z,"And it's not like he speaks Engish badly, he just has an accent.  And then he storms off?  What a gaping asshole."
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightHippo,2020-04-27T16:30:41.017Z,The both sides is that she should be more considerate of his not liking his accent.
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightHippo,2020-04-27T16:30:53.171Z,but when weighed against her being excluded... it's clear who was in the right.
49,3,5ea6f618002f966295b20008,excitedBison,2020-04-27T16:30:59.154Z,agreed
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763be9,novelZebra,2020-04-27T16:31:07.491Z,The son should be considerate of that too and just not talk to the husband either.
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightHippo,2020-04-27T16:31:16.657Z,haha
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c05,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-27T16:31:42.321Z,"his accent is his own problem, no one said his accent sucks"
49,3,5ea0dd3c9dc0406f8988bd94,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-27T16:31:54.653Z,Unfortunately she only spoke English to him.  If she had said something in German instead of storming off he would have just surrendered.
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightHippo,2020-04-27T16:31:57.795Z,"Exactly. I was just saying what the ""other side"" would be"
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d2b,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-27T16:31:59.374Z,He needs to stop being so insecure.
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightHippo,2020-04-27T16:32:02.136Z,even if i think it's silly
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c05,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-27T16:32:13.024Z,true
49,3,5ea6f618002f966295b20008,excitedBison,2020-04-27T16:32:18.210Z,so no it is 
49,3,5ea0dd3c9dc0406f8988bd94,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-27T16:32:20.822Z,"Correct, he does need to stop being insecure.  He needs to be accomodating."
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c05,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-27T16:32:49.858Z,"let's vote, I'm saying not an asshole"
49,3,5ea6f550002f966295b1fffd,lightHippo,2020-04-27T16:32:56.580Z,Not the asshole.
49,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763be9,novelZebra,2020-04-27T16:32:56.722Z,Agreed.
50,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762a16,inspiredDolphin,2020-04-27T19:27:48.805Z,"I believe he is the asshole, why is he even there if he doesn't want to communicate with his mother.  He needs to be the conduit between the two, not shut one out in favor of the other."
50,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762a16,inspiredDolphin,2020-04-27T19:28:30.141Z,"I understand wanting to make his husband feel comfortable, but he could just as easily go to a hotel then if he only wants to make his husband feel good."
50,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762c75,lightBison,2020-04-27T19:29:01.049Z,"I think OP is the asshole. They already stated that they DO in fact know how to speak English but are just SHY.  After all, they're in her house. How disrespectful."
50,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762a16,inspiredDolphin,2020-04-27T19:29:03.548Z,"Totally his choice on how he wants to live his life, but I really don't see his side at all in this since he is only with his mother for the weekend."
50,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7629da,eagerBear,2020-04-27T19:29:15.314Z,I think that he's the asshole as well. 
50,2,5ea721c43ecdad55471ffa70,brightElephant,2020-04-27T19:29:25.221Z,"I don't believe they are the asshole. It is very difficult to be in a different country as it is, so making their husband more comfortable seems like a reasonable choice."
50,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7629f2,openCamel,2020-04-27T19:29:31.172Z,I think they are an asshole as well
50,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7629da,eagerBear,2020-04-27T19:29:35.650Z,"As lightBison noted, they are able to speak English but just shy. "
50,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7629da,eagerBear,2020-04-27T19:29:54.397Z,"There is a middle ground, where they can speak German and translate so his mother is included in the conversation"
50,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762a16,inspiredDolphin,2020-04-27T19:30:14.228Z,I see your point brightElephant but they are enjoying the hospitality of OPs mother at no charge I assume and she does not get to see OP very often.
50,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7629da,eagerBear,2020-04-27T19:30:17.188Z,But to interact solely in one language leaves her out completely. This is unjustified when they're staying in her house. 
50,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7629f2,openCamel,2020-04-27T19:30:39.025Z,"Yes, I agree. Encouraging the husband to speak English, but making it more ""okay"" to mess up or ask for a word would be helpful"
50,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7629da,eagerBear,2020-04-27T19:30:40.595Z,"Take the reverse scenario, if he only spoke English to his mother and left his husband in the dark. Would he be the asshole in that scenario? "
50,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7629da,eagerBear,2020-04-27T19:31:09.425Z,"I think the answer is yes. If that's situation than how can he not be the asshole in this reverse scenario, especially when they're staying with mom. "
50,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762a16,inspiredDolphin,2020-04-27T19:31:22.452Z,I think OP has the responsibility to be the translator between the two.  This will also help his husband become more comfortable around family.
50,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762c75,lightBison,2020-04-27T19:31:28.983Z,i 100 percent agree eagerBear it's her house. I mean they can go somewhere else but not in her house especially if they are going to make the entire house awkward by only speaking to themselves. WEIRD.
50,2,5ea721c43ecdad55471ffa70,brightElephant,2020-04-27T19:31:29.516Z,I do think translating for the mother is a good option. 
50,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7629f2,openCamel,2020-04-27T19:31:49.250Z,"Yes, helping to bridge the communication gap is helpful"

It' not right to exclude the mother from the conversation. Especially in their own home and then only speak French to each other.

51,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762710,curiousHorse,2020-04-27T19:12:10.470Z,I think she was just gelous of her son and wanted to make him feel bad.

51,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762710,curiousHorse,2020-04-27T19:13:21.519Z,The fact that he left shows he did not have a good relation with his mother. 
51,0,5d482ea521c9be351f76270e,lightBison,2020-04-27T19:13:32.788Z,Personally - I feel left out when people are speaking in a manner that I cannot understand when I am part of the group.  Even if it is a topic I don't understand not just the language.

51,3,5d482ea521c9be351f76254b,livelyBear,2020-04-27T19:58:14.855Z,"Guys, it's not a she. The only female is the mother. The person writing this a guy and he is married to a man."
51,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763df5,openOtter,2020-04-27T19:58:18.885Z,"So what do you guys think overall, asshole, or no?"
51,3,5d482ea521c9be351f76270e,novelBison,2020-04-27T19:58:26.484Z,it's a coin toss - but in the end i think that the poster is slightly more of the asshole
51,3,5d482ea521c9be351f76254b,livelyBear,2020-04-27T19:58:27.244Z,"Yes, asshole"
51,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762519,curiousGiraffe,2020-04-27T19:58:38.540Z,"Yeah, a reluctant asshole"
51,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762540,fulfilledCamel,2020-04-27T19:58:43.597Z,"Asshole, made no attempt to include mother."
51,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762586,brightGorilla,2020-04-27T19:58:48.591Z,"I see both sides, but yes, asshole"
51,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762886,inspiredElephant,2020-04-27T19:58:50.575Z,yes assshole
51,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763df5,openOtter,2020-04-27T19:59:08.728Z,"Lol, I like that, reluctant asshole. You guys have convinced me because of the argument that she was an asshole either way. "
51,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762710,excitedMonkey,2020-04-27T19:59:13.912Z,"I agree with you all, she was not noce"
51,3,5d482ea521c9be351f76254b,livelyBear,2020-04-27T19:59:43.523Z,"Yeah, we unfortunately need to say that the poster (male) is an asshole even though he was in a difficult spot. "
51,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762710,excitedMonkey,2020-04-27T19:59:55.578Z,"Yes, livelyBear "
51,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762519,curiousGiraffe,2020-04-27T19:59:58.396Z,Family seems to put everyone in a position where they have to be an asshole at some point in there life.
51,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762710,excitedMonkey,2020-04-27T20:00:01.499Z,you are right
51,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763df5,openOtter,2020-04-27T20:00:02.975Z,"Great job guys, we have all agreed that she was an asshole because she just had to be unfortunately."
51,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762710,excitedMonkey,2020-04-27T20:00:12.612Z,yes
51,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762710,excitedMonkey,2020-04-27T20:00:17.155Z,she was
52,0,5ea724e43ecdad55471ffdce,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-27T19:14:51.638Z,I think they're not really an asshole but they need to compromise
52,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cc,excitedGorilla,2020-04-27T19:15:10.182Z,"My initial impression is that this person is the asshole. It seems as though what started off as help for her parents has become an assumption and a duty, whilst her parents have made no progress in learning English."
52,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7626f2,lightBison,2020-04-27T19:15:12.896Z,I think she is for pushing her parents off all the time on her husband.  I'm sure he has things to do too.
52,0,5ea728b83ecdad55472000c2,novelOtter,2020-04-27T19:15:13.051Z,I think they are not the asshole but yes they need to appriecate the spouse effort
52,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7624c6,curiousDolphin,2020-04-27T19:15:13.787Z,I feel if it's only occasional then it's perfectly fine
52,0,5ea724e43ecdad55471ffdce,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-27T19:15:35.147Z,They could share the work of translating more evenly
52,0,5ea728b83ecdad55472000c2,novelOtter,2020-04-27T19:15:52.762Z,"i mean in the end, if the spouse has an issue with it, they are the asshole for continuing to expect it"
52,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763554,openMonkey,2020-04-27T19:15:59.377Z,I think that neither one is an asshole(that's a rather strong term).  He is complaining about a minor inconvenience though.
52,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76295f,livelyCamel,2020-04-27T19:16:11.467Z,It is not a big deal when he spends his time helping his wife's family.  Her family is his family too.  
52,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cc,excitedGorilla,2020-04-27T19:16:14.133Z,"It also never really states how often they call, which can depend from each side how 'rarely' this is happening."
52,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7626f2,lightBison,2020-04-27T19:16:19.635Z,She could also help her parents get set up to learn English.
52,0,5ea728b83ecdad55472000c2,novelOtter,2020-04-27T19:16:35.155Z,Yeah but for them to learn english is a huge ordeal
52,0,5ea724e43ecdad55471ffdce,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-27T19:16:37.210Z,I think they can resolve it pretty easily by talking so no one has to be the asshole
52,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7624c6,curiousDolphin,2020-04-27T19:16:39.196Z,"Since its based on how busy they are, maybe it could shift back and forth to share responsibility."
52,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cc,excitedGorilla,2020-04-27T19:16:41.766Z,"Even though they are family, you have no obligation to help them every single time. "
52,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763554,openMonkey,2020-04-27T19:16:53.345Z,The whole thing is a minor issue compared to people with real problems.
52,0,5ea728b83ecdad55472000c2,novelOtter,2020-04-27T19:16:57.679Z,true
52,0,5ea728b83ecdad55472000c2,novelOtter,2020-04-27T19:17:13.240Z,so whats the vote?
52,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763554,openMonkey,2020-04-27T19:17:26.769Z,I agree that they probably just need to talk about it more.
52,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7626f2,lightBison,2020-04-27T19:17:34.327Z,It is a huge ordeal to learn another language but I'd be more happy to help someone if I knew they were trying to help themself
52,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7624c6,curiousDolphin,2020-04-27T19:17:35.505Z,I also feel that you know what you are getting into early on. So he was aware.
52,0,5ea724e43ecdad55471ffdce,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-27T19:18:01.337Z,I think whoever said asshole is too strong a term is right and they're not the asshole
52,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76295f,livelyCamel,2020-04-27T19:18:22.730Z,He is an asshole.
52,0,5ea728b83ecdad55472000c2,novelOtter,2020-04-27T19:18:25.162Z,"And learning english would only help their entire lives, it would be a huge help to them overall and maybe they need the push to do it?"
52,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cc,excitedGorilla,2020-04-27T19:18:37.350Z,Her family also live in America and it must be a massive hassle to not speak English here.
52,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7624c6,curiousDolphin,2020-04-27T19:18:41.094Z,My answer is that she is not and he is being selfish at the moment.
52,0,5ea728b83ecdad55472000c2,novelOtter,2020-04-27T19:18:51.444Z,"agree, she is not the asshole"
52,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7626f2,lightBison,2020-04-27T19:19:12.486Z,I agree it's a strong word to use but in this case I'd say she's the asshole for expecting her husband to always handle her parents. She could easily show them how to use an online learning tool or translation tool.
52,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76295f,livelyCamel,2020-04-27T19:19:19.582Z,She is  not an asshole.
52,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763554,openMonkey,2020-04-27T19:19:21.285Z,"If I had to make a choice then I would choose him, but I would just call him a whiner.  As far As I can tell she is not the asshole."
52,0,5ea728b83ecdad55472000c2,novelOtter,2020-04-27T19:19:40.602Z,"so we have one member that thinks she is the asshole, the rest do not?"
52,0,5ea724e43ecdad55471ffdce,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-27T19:19:51.434Z,"she's also working and in school, so it's unreasonable for the parents to expect her help constantly"
52,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7624c6,curiousDolphin,2020-04-27T19:20:21.663Z,She is not the asshole in this situation. She has been busy and he should understand that and help occasionally.
52,0,5ea728b83ecdad55472000c2,novelOtter,2020-04-27T19:20:28.213Z,can we come to an aggreement?
52,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cc,excitedGorilla,2020-04-27T19:20:39.527Z,Her parents really have no excuse after this long to still rely on her husband to translate.
52,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763554,openMonkey,2020-04-27T19:20:55.527Z,She should still help if she has the time and he's busy.
52,2,5ea724e43ecdad55471ffdce,brightMonkey,2020-04-27T19:44:36.216Z,I think the OP isn't telling the whole story when he says he was completely respectful
52,2,5d482ea621c9be351f76295f,fulfilledOtter,2020-04-27T19:44:46.758Z,It is frustrating when your daily activity is interrupted.
52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7626f2,eagerGorilla,2020-04-27T19:44:50.072Z,I don't think he's being an asshole at all.
52,2,5ea728b83ecdad55472000c2,novelZebra,2020-04-27T19:44:56.863Z,I think that he is kind of the asshole because he was rude about it and very much expected the mother to learn english.  i can see encouraging her but demanding is just making him the asshole
52,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763554,excitedHippo,2020-04-27T19:44:59.024Z,"He very well may be the asshole, but I am taking his word for it that he was very polite."
52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cc,livelyElephant,2020-04-27T19:45:11.322Z,The verdict is based on if he is the asshole for telling her to learn English instead of just helping her.
52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7626f2,eagerGorilla,2020-04-27T19:45:12.013Z,It's frustrating when someone won't try to help themself.  If they were trying then it's easier to help them.
52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7624c6,openBear,2020-04-27T19:45:12.200Z,I feel that he is venting online but probably wasn't a total jerk when speaking to the family member.
52,2,5ea724e43ecdad55471ffdce,brightMonkey,2020-04-27T19:45:27.086Z,"the whole family got upset at him, so I think there may be a pattern of being less than respectful"
52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cc,livelyElephant,2020-04-27T19:45:30.032Z,"I feel like he isn't the asshole for wanting them to learn some English after 8 years, but it does sound like he did it in a nasty way."
52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cc,livelyElephant,2020-04-27T19:45:59.986Z,"Even if you take into account his version where he said it nicely, his post clearly gives off the vibe that he is a bit of an asshole in general."
52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7624c6,openBear,2020-04-27T19:46:03.534Z,I believe the family member has been coddled since they can't even do basic things such as order food and he's rightfully frustrated.
52,2,5ea728b83ecdad55472000c2,novelZebra,2020-04-27T19:46:05.259Z,"just because he could learn another language doesn't mean another person can, that's an expectation that is totally unfair I feel"
52,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763554,excitedHippo,2020-04-27T19:46:17.569Z,"I think that telling someone to learn English and helping them to find resources to do so is considerate and helpful, but It depends on how respectful he was."
52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cc,livelyElephant,2020-04-27T19:46:35.521Z,"I mean, it's not hard to learn a language in 8 years when you live in the country it is spoken."
52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7626f2,eagerGorilla,2020-04-27T19:46:40.769Z,I think he should of said it to her differently but I don't think he's an asshole.  
52,2,5ea724e43ecdad55471ffdce,brightMonkey,2020-04-27T19:46:43.086Z,I think he's right to be frustrated but based on their reactions I don't think he expressed it perfectly respectfully
52,2,5ea728b83ecdad55472000c2,novelZebra,2020-04-27T19:46:49.291Z,I feel like it might be harder than you think
52,2,5ea728b83ecdad55472000c2,novelZebra,2020-04-27T19:46:54.002Z,depending on your age
52,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763554,excitedHippo,2020-04-27T19:46:58.341Z,His tone leads me to believe that he might have been a little more rude than he let on.
52,2,5ea728b83ecdad55472000c2,novelZebra,2020-04-27T19:47:06.494Z,I agree
52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7624c6,openBear,2020-04-27T19:47:06.634Z,"I feel he may have finally snapped because he's done it for so long. That's human, not being an asshole. "
52,2,5d482ea621c9be351f76295f,fulfilledOtter,2020-04-27T19:47:13.922Z,"I, however, believe he needs to arrange his time to help our his wife's family because we all have our own difficulty."
52,2,5ea724e43ecdad55471ffdce,brightMonkey,2020-04-27T19:47:32.327Z,"if he only did exactly what he said I don't think they would have said he was a ""racist trump supporter etc"""
52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cc,livelyElephant,2020-04-27T19:47:47.132Z,After 8 years in the country without being able to even order food from a restaurant you are taking the piss.
52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7626f2,eagerGorilla,2020-04-27T19:48:00.943Z,I think he could of handled it differently but I can understand his frustration.
52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7626f2,eagerGorilla,2020-04-27T19:48:21.205Z,He almost sounds a little cocky that he learned several languages fast and expects others to that fast.  
52,2,5ea728b83ecdad55472000c2,novelZebra,2020-04-27T19:48:22.578Z,yeah I think you might be right livelyElephant I didn't think of it like that
52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7624c6,openBear,2020-04-27T19:48:27.548Z,When you suddenly stop doing what people expect they can be rather hateful and accuse you of things that aren't true. 
52,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763554,excitedHippo,2020-04-27T19:48:35.589Z,I agree that nothing he said would indicate that he was racist or a Trump supporter.  Either they(the extended family) are the ones being assholes or he left some things out.
52,2,5ea728b83ecdad55472000c2,novelZebra,2020-04-27T19:48:59.450Z,I think you might have made me change my opinoin

52,2,5ea724e43ecdad55471ffdce,brightMonkey,2020-04-27T19:49:41.581Z,"it sounds like there's more to the story, and that OP isn't a reliable narrator"

52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625cc,livelyElephant,2020-04-27T19:50:01.594Z,Glad I am not in that family.

52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7624c6,openBear,2020-04-27T19:50:32.666Z,I believe that he is not the asshole because I think they are just angry that he no longer is doing what has come to be expected of him. 
52,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7626f2,eagerGorilla,2020-04-27T19:51:02.921Z,I just think there is more resentment there then just this one situation

53,1,5ea721e23ecdad55471ffa74,livelyOtter,2020-04-27T19:45:37.858Z,She should have approached it more nicely. The guy couldnt speak good english and theyre young
53,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762be2,curiousHorse,2020-04-27T19:45:38.578Z,i  think it  was  rude  of  the kids  to speak  french the whole time when they know english
53,1,5ea1db9cde5d74641b672eca,eagerElephant,2020-04-27T19:45:56.010Z,"Honestly, I understand why she is frustrated. I do not know if ""disrespectful"" is the right word to use, but everyone wants to feel included, especially in their own home."
53,1,5ea634947c882f6974ff30ff,brightGorilla,2020-04-27T19:45:56.372Z,"I think while it doesn't really matter what language the son and husband speak, the mother can assume some respect for the fact that she only speaks english."

53,1,5ea634947c882f6974ff30ff,brightGorilla,2020-04-27T19:46:55.042Z,The mother is not the asshole in my opinion.
53,1,5ea1db9cde5d74641b672eca,eagerElephant,2020-04-27T19:46:57.117Z,"I don't think she is the asshole. Misguided a bit, but not an asshole."
53,1,5ea721e23ecdad55471ffa74,livelyOtter,2020-04-27T19:47:09.011Z,"If she was nicer then they would have probnably learned and adjusted, so as the adult she is the asshole, i think"
53,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762be2,curiousHorse,2020-04-27T19:47:09.558Z,when  I  dated a  french canadain  her and  her  entire  family spoke english around me  and  when their  friends  refused  to  speak english  even they  found it  rude 
53,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7625fa,novelBison,2020-04-27T19:47:13.169Z,Agreed! Misguided non asshole.
53,1,5ea634947c882f6974ff30ff,brightGorilla,2020-04-27T19:47:24.205Z,"You're right. A little misguided, and maybe she is making a big deal out of nothing, but she's not an asshole for this."
53,1,5ea12f30de5d74641b66be9c,lightMonkey,2020-04-27T19:47:34.145Z,It is kinda rude but at the same time there's not much the dude can do if he'd be butchering English and taking 10 times as long to get something across. No one's really at fault here
53,1,5ea721e23ecdad55471ffa74,livelyOtter,2020-04-27T19:47:59.977Z,"In the end she isnt, I agree. They shouldnt freak out over a bit over frustration "
53,1,5ea634947c882f6974ff30ff,brightGorilla,2020-04-27T19:48:49.367Z,They should definitely be more sensitive to the situation instead of storming off.
53,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762be2,curiousHorse,2020-04-27T19:48:58.320Z,i agree
53,1,5ea721e23ecdad55471ffa74,livelyOtter,2020-04-27T19:49:12.504Z,"yes, both sides considered. A family history of their relationship might have made this easier"
53,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7625fa,novelBison,2020-04-27T19:49:15.993Z,"I can understand the sensitivity, but they should understand how she feels."
53,1,5ea1db9cde5d74641b672eca,eagerElephant,2020-04-27T19:49:21.112Z,"It might be rooted in his insecurity about speaking the other language. I've been in multiple situations where I was the only  person not fluent in Spanish, it was painful for all involved and especially mentally taxing. "
53,1,5ea721e23ecdad55471ffa74,livelyOtter,2020-04-27T19:49:33.793Z,all true
53,1,5ea1db9cde5d74641b672eca,eagerElephant,2020-04-27T19:49:35.772Z,"It still does not make his reaction appropriate, just maybe some context!"
53,1,5ea634947c882f6974ff30ff,brightGorilla,2020-04-27T19:50:06.547Z,Yes. I think it might be better to see this as an opportunity to improve the english in a low-risk environment instead of being insecure and therefore only speaking french. 
53,1,5ea634947c882f6974ff30ff,brightGorilla,2020-04-27T19:50:34.272Z,"In other words, I think there is more risk for him speaking French and coming off as rude to the mother (clearly) than having a bit of trouble speaking English."
53,1,5ea721e23ecdad55471ffa74,livelyOtter,2020-04-27T19:51:19.135Z,"I'll say no, not an asshole. They're an emotional family and don't have the best communication skills"
53,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762be2,curiousHorse,2020-04-27T19:51:32.825Z,i agree   no  not a  asshole  
53,1,5ea1db9cde5d74641b672eca,eagerElephant,2020-04-27T19:51:37.716Z,I agree! Hopefully this is a learning experience for all!

53,3,5ea634947c882f6974ff30ff,delightedOtter,2020-04-27T20:15:29.815Z,"I think that this person should respect that his mother wants to reconnect with him, and that her only language is English."
53,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762be2,openGorilla,2020-04-27T20:15:51.493Z,I  believe it  was a  bit  unreasonable of  her  to exclude her  mom    she  could  have translated  everything
53,3,5ea634947c882f6974ff30ff,delightedOtter,2020-04-27T20:16:03.307Z,I think both of these people are men

53,3,5ea634947c882f6974ff30ff,delightedOtter,2020-04-27T20:16:37.509Z,I totally agree.
53,3,5ea1db9cde5d74641b672eca,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-27T20:16:40.713Z,"To avoid misgendering, I'll just say American Spouse (AS) and German Spouse (GS). I do not think AS was intending to be rude, but ultimately was."
53,3,5ea634947c882f6974ff30ff,delightedOtter,2020-04-27T20:16:58.155Z,"They give the genders at the beginning, so no need to worry!"

53,3,5ea634947c882f6974ff30ff,delightedOtter,2020-04-27T20:17:37.542Z,It's all good.
53,3,5ea634947c882f6974ff30ff,delightedOtter,2020-04-27T20:17:58.727Z,I think that the fact that the husband is slightly insecure about english is not enough to make the mother feel left out.
53,3,5ea12f30de5d74641b66be9c,excitedDolphin,2020-04-27T20:18:05.125Z,"Technically not an asshole thing to do given the context, but his justifications are kinda assholish in themselves"
53,3,5ea634947c882f6974ff30ff,delightedOtter,2020-04-27T20:18:34.633Z,This is a low-risk environment and I am sure the mother would excuse any english trouble.
53,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762be2,openGorilla,2020-04-27T20:18:58.002Z,i agree. i think the mother  woudl  have  just been happy to be  included
53,3,5ea634947c882f6974ff30ff,delightedOtter,2020-04-27T20:19:21.562Z,"Also, if the boys were moving in or something, maybe I could understand there being a compromise between English and German. "
53,3,5ea1db9cde5d74641b672eca,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-27T20:19:21.758Z,"I know I would in that situation, especially if I do not get to see my son very often."
53,3,5ea634947c882f6974ff30ff,delightedOtter,2020-04-27T20:19:34.705Z,"However, they are only going to be there for a weekend, so they should respect the language of the mother."
53,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762be2,openGorilla,2020-04-27T20:19:58.938Z,exactly   and   they  can  talk more in german when in private  
53,3,5ea12f30de5d74641b66be9c,excitedDolphin,2020-04-27T20:21:22.191Z,"You can be right and still an asshole at the same time, so even with the context being passable im leaning towards asshole"
53,3,5ea12f30de5d74641b66be9c,excitedDolphin,2020-04-27T20:21:41.242Z,Regardless of whether hes right or not hes being a dick about it

54,0,5ea71fee3ecdad55471ff9b9,novelBison,2020-04-27T18:39:33.857Z,Hello
54,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640eb,curiousDolphin,2020-04-27T18:39:41.686Z,It must be difficult for your mother to have you living in another country for many months of the year.
54,0,5ea71fee3ecdad55471ff9b9,novelBison,2020-04-27T18:39:52.859Z,I agree
54,0,5ea6f514002f966295b1fffb,inspiredHippo,2020-04-27T18:39:54.880Z,openZebra
54,0,5ea6f514002f966295b1fffb,inspiredHippo,2020-04-27T18:39:59.247Z,I Agree
54,0,5ea71fee3ecdad55471ff9b9,novelBison,2020-04-27T18:39:59.770Z,I think the person should include the mother
54,0,5ea71f623ecdad55471ff9b1,brightHorse,2020-04-27T18:40:00.654Z,yes
54,0,5ea6f514002f966295b1fffb,inspiredHippo,2020-04-27T18:40:07.312Z,yeah
54,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640eb,curiousDolphin,2020-04-27T18:40:09.681Z,It would be difficult to not know what you are saying when you are feeding them and having them stay in your home
54,0,5ea71f623ecdad55471ff9b1,brightHorse,2020-04-27T18:40:12.305Z,I like My cuntry
54,0,5ea632967c882f6974ff2f5d,delightedBear,2020-04-27T18:40:39.641Z,Absolutely! It's only a weekend trip! Maybe if he were staying with the husband for longer and trying to acclimate him to English
54,0,5d482ea921c9be351f76373a,openZebra,2020-04-27T18:40:43.415Z,"I think that the mother should be included. The husband can easily use their phone to look up the word they're uncertain of, of the son can help translate for the husband."
54,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640eb,curiousDolphin,2020-04-27T18:40:43.580Z,"If mom was visiting them it would be different but being at mom's house, they should talk to mom"
54,0,5ea6f910002f966295b2006a,livelyElephant,2020-04-27T18:40:45.143Z,Hi team. I don't think there are any assholes in this scenario. But I do believe there should be some compromise. It is ok for OP to talk the language she wants but maybe not 100% of the time.
54,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762cc8,excitedGorilla,2020-04-27T18:40:49.421Z,I feel like this person is not the asshole. He chose this person to be with and he should make them feel comfortable. On the other hand though the partner should learn to speak english better to include the mom in the near future
54,0,5ea71fee3ecdad55471ff9b9,novelBison,2020-04-27T18:40:53.465Z,brightHorse that has nothing to do with this 
54,0,5ea71f623ecdad55471ff9b1,brightHorse,2020-04-27T18:41:05.699Z,yeah
54,0,5ea6f910002f966295b2006a,livelyElephant,2020-04-27T18:41:08.118Z,Maybe agree to involve everyone in the conversation during at least lunch and dinner?
54,0,5ea71fee3ecdad55471ff9b9,novelBison,2020-04-27T18:41:14.769Z,livelyElephant i agree

54,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762cc8,excitedGorilla,2020-04-27T18:41:23.182Z,Yes i agree too.

54,0,5ea632967c882f6974ff2f5d,delightedBear,2020-04-27T18:41:37.381Z,I agree there should be some compromise

54,0,5ea71f623ecdad55471ff9b1,brightHorse,2020-04-27T18:42:02.389Z,This is their own choice
54,0,5ea632967c882f6974ff2f5d,delightedBear,2020-04-27T18:42:04.384Z,Still think the poster is more asshole than not asshole 
54,0,5d482ea921c9be351f76373a,openZebra,2020-04-27T18:42:15.586Z,Yep! There are so many resources and I'm sure the mom wouldn't mind helping and learning some German phrases at the same time.

54,0,5ea6f514002f966295b1fffb,inspiredHippo,2020-04-27T18:43:17.352Z,why
54,0,5ea632967c882f6974ff2f5d,delightedBear,2020-04-27T18:43:24.864Z,But I like the idea of the mother trying to learn German so both she and the husband are slightly uncomfortable together

55,3,5ea1e538de5d74641b67621a,inspiredHippo,2020-04-27T19:17:44.548Z,Hello
55,3,5ea6f500002f966295b1fff8,livelyBear,2020-04-27T19:17:51.042Z,hello
55,3,5ea63e627c882f6974ff3235,curiousZebra,2020-04-27T19:17:57.732Z,This one was difficult but I do not think she is the asshole. She has a lot on her plate and her husband can help out sometimes.
55,3,5ea6f500002f966295b1fff8,livelyBear,2020-04-27T19:18:02.434Z,what you thingking

55,3,5ea6f500002f966295b1fff8,livelyBear,2020-04-27T19:18:26.420Z,she is asshole
55,3,5ea1e538de5d74641b67621a,inspiredHippo,2020-04-27T19:18:28.929Z,I can see what you're saying but it's also a bit unreasonable to expect him to continuously help out. 
55,3,5ea6f500002f966295b1fff8,livelyBear,2020-04-27T19:18:41.986Z,he is helpeing
55,3,5ea71efe3ecdad55471ff9a6,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-27T19:18:52.898Z,She is ridiculous and sounds like a terrible person.
55,3,5ea1e538de5d74641b67621a,inspiredHippo,2020-04-27T19:18:59.783Z,I think him saying that they should try to learn English will help them more in the future
55,3,5ea6f500002f966295b1fff8,livelyBear,2020-04-27T19:19:02.333Z,i agree
55,3,5ea63e627c882f6974ff3235,curiousZebra,2020-04-27T19:19:18.055Z,I guess all we can determine now is that she is not the asshole for needing some help as well. What they need to do as a family is come together and compromise somehow
55,3,5ea6f500002f966295b1fff8,livelyBear,2020-04-27T19:19:21.341Z,that's good sound
55,3,5ea1e538de5d74641b67621a,inspiredHippo,2020-04-27T19:19:21.692Z,I think she's the asshole in this situatuon
55,3,5ea71efe3ecdad55471ff9a6,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-27T19:19:48.573Z,She openly mocks her husband and expects him to be on call for her whole family.
55,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763cdf,excitedGiraffe,2020-04-27T19:20:02.509Z,"I kind of do think she is being an ""asshole."" For one she should not be expecting her husband to take care of her mother because she is too busy. And saying her parents should not have to try is not any better."
55,3,5ea6f500002f966295b1fff8,livelyBear,2020-04-27T19:20:03.852Z,yes
55,3,5ea1e538de5d74641b67621a,inspiredHippo,2020-04-27T19:20:03.938Z,"Of course she has a lot going on, but he doesn't have to be there 24/7 to help out."
55,3,5ea1e538de5d74641b67621a,inspiredHippo,2020-04-27T19:20:33.284Z,"He also learned Spanish, so he's helping to his highest ability "
55,3,5ea63e627c882f6974ff3235,curiousZebra,2020-04-27T19:20:47.795Z,"Considering that she did say her parents shouldn't have to try, I change my answer to she is the asshole."
55,3,5ea6f500002f966295b1fff8,livelyBear,2020-04-27T19:20:48.812Z,they should think before
55,3,5ea71efe3ecdad55471ff9a6,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-27T19:20:56.843Z,Not learning a language after years in a country is just laziness.
55,3,5ea1e538de5d74641b67621a,inspiredHippo,2020-04-27T19:21:17.137Z,so does everyone agree here?
55,3,5ea6f500002f966295b1fff8,livelyBear,2020-04-27T19:21:24.379Z,yes

55,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763cdf,excitedGiraffe,2020-04-27T19:21:40.392Z,I wonder who would help if she did not have her husband...
55,3,5ea71efe3ecdad55471ff9a6,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-27T19:21:48.313Z,If he brought his family to El Salvador and refused to learn Spanish she would probably freak out.
55,3,5ea6f500002f966295b1fff8,livelyBear,2020-04-27T19:22:02.516Z,good sound
55,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763cdf,excitedGiraffe,2020-04-27T19:23:09.624Z,She would probably not take well to him not taking the time to do anything extra.
56,0,5ea63ba67c882f6974ff320d,livelyBear,2020-04-27T18:51:03.489Z,"I'm fairly flexible on my opinion, but I'm of the belief the perosn is being the asshole by assuming there was negative intent when there probably was not"
56,0,5ea63ba67c882f6974ff320d,livelyBear,2020-04-27T18:51:23.680Z,What are your opinions?
56,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763208,eagerElephant,2020-04-27T18:51:31.558Z,I agree. You can't assume they were talking about you and he may not be comfortable speaking english as a 2nd language
56,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762d4f,openDolphin,2020-04-27T18:51:38.195Z,I believe the person is the asshole because they've invited a foreign person into their house and should expect a language barrier.
56,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ab,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-27T18:51:50.045Z,I don't think it is nice when people can speak your language but choose to speak another and leave you out it's rude.
56,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ab,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-27T18:52:11.250Z,The son was an asshole for leaving his mother out of the conversation. 
56,0,5ea63ba67c882f6974ff320d,livelyBear,2020-04-27T18:52:18.134Z,"True, but it does sound like the French person did have problems speaking"

56,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763208,eagerElephant,2020-04-27T18:52:35.416Z,"But would you expect them to speak English all the time, even if it was a challenge?"
56,0,5ea63ba67c882f6974ff320d,livelyBear,2020-04-27T18:52:52.010Z,There is Google translate that could be helpful
56,0,5ea63ba67c882f6974ff320d,livelyBear,2020-04-27T18:52:57.287Z,I don't think it came off as malicious based on the context here

56,0,5ea63ba67c882f6974ff320d,livelyBear,2020-04-27T18:53:37.963Z,I agree that maybe the son should try to be a translator but I don't think any of this is malicious

56,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76354a,novelHorse,2020-04-27T18:55:06.816Z,It may come off rude. But maybe she could ask why they're speaking French instead of jumping to conclusions 
56,0,5ea63ba67c882f6974ff320d,livelyBear,2020-04-27T18:55:12.761Z,novelHorse very true

60,0,5d482ea421c9be351f7622cd,eagerBear,2020-04-28T03:24:11.259Z,I side with the mother. I think the only way she could be the asshole is if she blew up at the two of them and just didn't mention it in her post.

60,0,5ea790d221028d2296a49375,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T03:27:29.970Z,I agree 
60,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76287d,excitedBison,2020-04-28T03:27:34.135Z, I think she is not an asshole.  She wanted to talk with them but clearly they left her out.
60,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763ec5,fulfilledOtter,2020-04-28T03:28:00.851Z,No I wouldn't but I also wouldn't refuse to speak my MIL's language around her even at that age
60,0,5d482ea421c9be351f7621db,delightedElephant,2020-04-28T03:28:03.036Z,"shes not an asshole, just being a mom and wanted to be included"
60,2,5ea76260fd339b022f9cebd6,livelyCamel,2020-04-28T03:51:28.183Z,I think the son should have just spoken both to make both of them comfortable
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762215,curiousElephant,2020-04-28T03:51:40.333Z,She rarely spoke English or translated to English for her husband to her mother?
60,2,5d482ea621c9be351f76287d,openHorse,2020-04-28T03:51:54.140Z,I think the son is being an asshole.
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f7622cd,eagerGorilla,2020-04-28T03:52:01.793Z,I think he is kind of the asshole. He could translate and help his partner learn english while teaching the mom some German.
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f7621db,brightOtter,2020-04-28T03:52:12.270Z,i think he is the asshole
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762215,curiousElephant,2020-04-28T03:52:16.491Z,It's embarassing because I have the opposite opinion from last time. maybe everyone agrees then.
60,2,5d482ea621c9be351f76287d,openHorse,2020-04-28T03:52:20.233Z,I think there are ways to make them both feel comfortable.
60,2,5ea76260fd339b022f9cebd6,livelyCamel,2020-04-28T03:52:22.455Z,The sons bf should have been okay with being uncomfortable for just a little 
60,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ec5,lightHippo,2020-04-28T03:52:25.770Z,"They're the assholes. ^ Right? kid could have translated if the husband felt uncomfortable speaking english, but the other side is, they live there half the year and he doesn't feel comfortable speaking english?!"
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762215,curiousElephant,2020-04-28T03:52:32.699Z,"I thought it was a daughter, this is confusing."
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762215,curiousElephant,2020-04-28T03:52:48.169Z,"OK, I misread it."
60,2,5ea790d221028d2296a49375,excitedBear,2020-04-28T03:52:50.539Z,"I think he is on the wrong side here since theyre living in her house. He said that it's his right to be able to speak whatver he wants, but it's also her house so he could kick them both out"
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f7622cd,eagerGorilla,2020-04-28T03:52:50.573Z,It was a gay male couple.
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762215,curiousElephant,2020-04-28T03:53:01.386Z,I don't understand why the son wouldn't translate the German for the mother.
60,2,5d482ea621c9be351f76287d,openHorse,2020-04-28T03:53:05.480Z,I think the couple should talk to each other about speaking English because there at her house.
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762215,curiousElephant,2020-04-28T03:53:18.299Z,Thanks yes I read it wrong.
60,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ec5,lightHippo,2020-04-28T03:53:24.596Z,I don't understand why if he lives in the United States 50% of the time he's uncomfortable speaking english?!
60,2,5ea790d221028d2296a49375,excitedBear,2020-04-28T03:53:30.248Z,"Both of them could have just talked to her in english, and when they're awayin their private room, they can choose to speak german to each other "
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f7622cd,eagerGorilla,2020-04-28T03:53:53.545Z,"Yeah, the whole point of going to spend time with the mother would be to include her in the conversation."
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f7621db,brightOtter,2020-04-28T03:53:53.948Z,i know they live part time in the us and germany...i know he could help him
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762215,curiousElephant,2020-04-28T03:53:56.059Z,"I agree that the son was wrong, he was just too lazy to translate really."
60,2,5d482ea621c9be351f76287d,openHorse,2020-04-28T03:54:07.944Z,I think the guy is considering his boyfriends feelings too much and they should make his mom happy.
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762215,curiousElephant,2020-04-28T03:54:19.818Z,"And the husband was wrong, too, but I'm not going to judge him that much."
60,2,5ea790d221028d2296a49375,excitedBear,2020-04-28T03:54:24.328Z,"And from his perspectivie, I also think that the mother could have handled it more gracefully, like in previous scenarios "
60,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ec5,lightHippo,2020-04-28T03:54:27.529Z,"I think the kids are rude as heck. Mom is providing meals and somewhere to stay, the least you can do is bother including your mom in some conversations."
60,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ec5,lightHippo,2020-04-28T03:54:36.301Z,even SOME of them.
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f7622cd,eagerGorilla,2020-04-28T03:54:36.881Z,The mother should be included because she had not seen her son for quite a while.
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f7621db,brightOtter,2020-04-28T03:54:37.354Z,"for them to visit her, they should just speak english"
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762215,curiousElephant,2020-04-28T03:55:00.026Z,"I got the impression this mother at least scolded the son in private, and didn't ream out his husband."
60,2,5ea790d221028d2296a49375,excitedBear,2020-04-28T03:55:22.935Z,"I think it was super nice of the mom to house them at first, doing something as simple as speaking english to her when they see her is not that hard of a task "
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762215,curiousElephant,2020-04-28T03:55:29.147Z,They were kind of using the mother for food. I don't understand why they were even visiting.
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f7621db,brightOtter,2020-04-28T03:55:52.248Z,"right, they can have their sidebar covo later. especially since shes providing for them"
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762215,curiousElephant,2020-04-28T03:56:06.762Z,It seems like everyone here agrees pretty much this time?
60,2,5ea790d221028d2296a49375,excitedBear,2020-04-28T03:56:08.735Z,"I think the son's tone was a bit overacting, since in fact we're not even sure if she was that rude "
60,2,5ea76260fd339b022f9cebd6,livelyCamel,2020-04-28T03:56:22.424Z,Yes I believe most of us agree
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f7621db,brightOtter,2020-04-28T03:56:37.164Z,a little more consideration from the son would have been nice
60,2,5ea790d221028d2296a49375,excitedBear,2020-04-28T03:56:42.197Z,ye i think we all agree
60,2,5d482ea621c9be351f76287d,openHorse,2020-04-28T03:57:12.697Z,i would conclude that the person was being an asshole
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762215,curiousElephant,2020-04-28T03:57:15.274Z,We conclude that it was rude to speak mostly German the whole weekend and then feel like that was their right.
60,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ec5,lightHippo,2020-04-28T03:57:41.025Z,Yes agreed. An effort to include the mother in her own home should have been made.
60,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ec5,lightHippo,2020-04-28T03:57:55.741Z,Don't forget to vote!
60,2,5d482ea421c9be351f7621db,brightOtter,2020-04-28T03:57:57.255Z,"agreed, he is the asshole"
61,0,5ea6330e7c882f6974ff30f2,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T03:07:32.799Z,Hello
61,0,5d482ea321c9be351f76216e,eagerDolphin,2020-04-28T03:07:36.208Z,hello everyone
61,0,5d482ea421c9be351f76232f,inspiredHippo,2020-04-28T03:07:39.965Z,Hello guys
61,0,5d482ea321c9be351f76216e,eagerDolphin,2020-04-28T03:07:41.637Z,what is everyone considering so far
61,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764223,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T03:07:45.739Z,hello! 
61,0,5d482ea421c9be351f76232f,inspiredHippo,2020-04-28T03:07:56.650Z,Well so far it definitely seems like the husband is being very rude.
61,0,5d482ea421c9be351f76232f,inspiredHippo,2020-04-28T03:08:08.887Z,Anybody else thinking the same?
61,0,5d482ea321c9be351f76216e,eagerDolphin,2020-04-28T03:08:15.031Z,Yeah I think the husband has some valid points but his attitude is very poor
61,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762423,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T03:08:22.443Z,I think she is the asshole because she isn't considering the husband's perspective.
61,0,5ea6330e7c882f6974ff30f2,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T03:08:37.399Z,"I think she is the Asshole because she has pretty much put her parents off on her husband and giving him more responsibility than he signed up for, but I agree with his attitude about it being very poor"
61,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762423,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T03:08:37.435Z,The husband didn't grow up having to translate for family members.
61,0,5d482ea321c9be351f762191,curiousHorse,2020-04-28T03:08:47.604Z,"Hello, I found this a scenario where I don't think there is an asshole. I think the wife is just in asking the husband to help out. I do think the wife could take some initiative to help as well. "
61,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762423,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T03:08:49.843Z,He didn't know that would be a responsibility in his marriage.
61,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764223,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T03:08:52.879Z,I disagree . I think he is being helpful and shouldn’t have to come to his mother in laws every beck and call. 
61,0,5d482ea421c9be351f76232f,inspiredHippo,2020-04-28T03:08:53.585Z,The husband however could describe the situation much better. They are his family after all and he is talking about them like they are random people
61,0,5d482ea321c9be351f76216e,eagerDolphin,2020-04-28T03:09:16.131Z,I really wish there was an option where both are the asshole or not
61,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762423,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T03:09:33.861Z,I think the husband is being helpful but sounds like he is being taken advantage of.
61,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764223,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T03:09:35.477Z,Yes! Option 3- they are both assholes LOL 
61,0,5ea6330e7c882f6974ff30f2,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T03:09:39.144Z,"Right, I found this one a middle of the road offense lol"
61,0,5d482ea321c9be351f762191,curiousHorse,2020-04-28T03:09:47.713Z,I agree he is being taken advantage of a bit and frustrated. 
61,0,5d482ea421c9be351f76232f,inspiredHippo,2020-04-28T03:09:53.160Z,I could go with they're both assholes as well. She could very well translate herself and he could have a better attitude.
61,0,5d482ea321c9be351f76216e,eagerDolphin,2020-04-28T03:10:03.411Z,I understand that the wife is really busy but she still needs to help out since they are her parents
61,0,5d482ea321c9be351f762191,curiousHorse,2020-04-28T03:10:25.197Z,The wife should show more of a willingness to help. She is pawning her parents off on her hubby. 
61,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762423,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T03:10:28.592Z,I vote that she is the asshole in this story.
61,0,5d482ea421c9be351f76232f,inspiredHippo,2020-04-28T03:10:30.481Z,I think he thinks he is being taken advantage of but the parents probably didn't have that intention
61,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764223,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T03:10:44.503Z,I agree as well! I don’t think the husband should have to help out ALL the time. Only when he is available. He has a life too! 
61,0,5ea6330e7c882f6974ff30f2,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T03:10:46.390Z,"Exactly, they are HER parents not his, and a few times helping might have been good but just leaving them to be his responsibility is simply being an asshole"
61,0,5d482ea421c9be351f76232f,inspiredHippo,2020-04-28T03:10:51.108Z,Has he tried to talk to them about it? Maybe they just think he wants to help
61,0,5d482ea321c9be351f76216e,eagerDolphin,2020-04-28T03:10:53.353Z,"Yeah I think since we have to pick one option, i'd say she was the asshole"
61,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762423,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T03:10:58.337Z,No one has bad intentions here. She is being an unintentional asshole.
61,0,5d482ea321c9be351f762191,curiousHorse,2020-04-28T03:11:25.253Z,I would agree with her being the asshole. She could show more support for her husband and relize she is asking a lot. 
61,0,5d482ea321c9be351f76216e,eagerDolphin,2020-04-28T03:11:42.084Z,I'm sure the wife knows from growing up how frustrating it can be having to translate for her parents
61,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764223,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T03:11:48.481Z,I agree with her being the asshole as well. 
61,0,5d482ea321c9be351f76216e,eagerDolphin,2020-04-28T03:11:50.419Z,so for her to put it all on her husband right now is not fair
61,0,5d482ea421c9be351f76232f,inspiredHippo,2020-04-28T03:12:16.184Z,"I have now changed my opinion to her being the asshole, she could be taking half the load off to help."
61,0,5d482ea821c9be351f76344f,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-04-28T03:12:45.522Z,I'm thinking she's the asshole since she's trying to p[ut it all on her husband
61,0,5d482ea421c9be351f76232f,inspiredHippo,2020-04-28T03:13:12.716Z,I also think she is the asshole as she expects him to do everything and is putting all of it on him and not thinking about him.
61,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764223,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T03:13:20.856Z,I believe this person is the asshole because she is expecting too much from her husband. 
61,0,5d482ea321c9be351f76216e,eagerDolphin,2020-04-28T03:13:35.588Z,Yeah she is definitely not doing enough herself right now
61,1,5d482ea321c9be351f76216e,eagerOtter,2020-04-28T03:22:02.939Z,Hello again
61,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76344f,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T03:22:07.996Z,not the asshole

61,1,5ea6330e7c882f6974ff30f2,delightedHorse,2020-04-28T03:22:10.914Z,I don't think he's the asshole
61,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764223,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-28T03:22:23.323Z,Not the asshole in this highly familiar story lol 
61,1,5ea6330e7c882f6974ff30f2,delightedHorse,2020-04-28T03:22:25.829Z,He is just incredibly frustrated with being a translator
61,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764223,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-28T03:22:52.253Z,I agree. I don’t blame him. 
61,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76232f,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T03:23:01.386Z,"I don't think he is either, just frustrated."
61,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762191,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T03:23:01.666Z,I can understand his frustration but he handled the situation horribly. I think he is definitley the asshole. 
61,1,5d482ea321c9be351f76216e,eagerOtter,2020-04-28T03:23:16.920Z,I feel he is the asshole as well
61,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764223,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-28T03:23:25.076Z,He said he didn’t say he’s sick of her shit and he was polite about it. 
61,1,5ea6330e7c882f6974ff30f2,delightedHorse,2020-04-28T03:23:25.727Z,"He respectfully offered his help and resources, he said he never was being disrespectful to her"
61,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76344f,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T03:23:43.123Z,"Take the language thing out and it's ""my mother in law constantly requires my assistance and needs to become more self sufficient."""
61,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76232f,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T03:23:50.790Z,I think he handled it poorly at first but based on his edit it seemed like he was rather polite and helpful
61,1,5d482ea321c9be351f76216e,eagerOtter,2020-04-28T03:24:08.693Z,I think he made a mistake in telling her to be independent 
61,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764223,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-28T03:24:20.444Z,"It’s not like he was being paid for all of it. Why should he put his life on hold for people who are too lazy to try to learn something themselves? There are resources out there, apps, etc. "
61,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76232f,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T03:24:32.383Z,"I agree with you there with the independent statement, however I don't think that one word makes him an asshole."
61,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764223,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-28T03:24:46.502Z,once in a while is fine but he was being bombarded 
61,1,5ea6330e7c882f6974ff30f2,delightedHorse,2020-04-28T03:24:53.719Z,I think the family was an asshole for not supporting him lol
61,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762191,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T03:24:53.838Z,"Regardless, if it is your mother-in-law and you married her daughter you are a lifeline to her. I would do anything to help my mother-in-law. "
61,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76232f,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T03:25:13.983Z,And he is helping her by giving her the resources to learn an invaluable language.
61,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764223,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-28T03:25:19.613Z,Yeah. Once in a while. Not with everything. I can see why he was annoyed. 
61,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764223,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-28T03:25:34.275Z,Agree with excitedHippo 
61,1,5d482ea321c9be351f76216e,eagerOtter,2020-04-28T03:25:36.599Z,I think it's likely the mother won't use those resources however 
61,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76344f,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T03:25:50.139Z,"it's an emotional response, he just feels overwhelmed, but what happens when he's not around to help? it would be good for the mother in law to lean on others less"
61,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762191,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T03:26:03.334Z,One thing to take into consideration is the ability to learn as well. It can be very overwhelming for people that are older and difficult to do. 
61,1,5ea6330e7c882f6974ff30f2,delightedHorse,2020-04-28T03:26:29.208Z,"Yes she seems very stubborn but he was just pretty much venting his frustrations which does not mean he's an asshole, an asshole would be someone who refused to help and called her a nuisance"
61,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764223,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-28T03:26:31.347Z,eagerOtter of course not. Why would she when she has someone she can run to every time she needs something already ? Being sarcastic btw. And totally agree with you. 
61,1,5d482ea821c9be351f76344f,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T03:26:45.690Z,"absolutely, its a delicate issue, very emotional to make big adjustments"
61,1,5d482ea321c9be351f76216e,eagerOtter,2020-04-28T03:26:51.844Z,I think he should have asked for his family to help more
61,1,5d482ea321c9be351f76216e,eagerOtter,2020-04-28T03:27:23.175Z,I agree that helping all the time like the last situation is too much
61,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764223,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-28T03:27:31.220Z,She needs to be more independent 
61,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762191,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T03:27:47.130Z,Talking to family would have ben a great choice. Confiding in his wife first and working together to help the situation. 
61,1,5d482ea321c9be351f76216e,eagerOtter,2020-04-28T03:27:50.916Z,I think it's very unlikely at her age that she will take the time to learn a new language 
61,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76232f,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T03:28:10.625Z,My overall conclusion is that he is not an asshole. He gave her resources and offered to help her learn something that will really help her and make her less dependent on others. He never insulted her either.
61,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762191,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T03:28:47.627Z,He should have talked to his wife about his frustrations and worked with her on a solution instead of making mother-in-law feeling put out. 
62,0,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,excitedBear,2020-04-28T02:47:38.859Z,We discuss here
62,0,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,excitedBear,2020-04-28T02:47:53.256Z,I will start by saying I do NOT think this person is an asshole.
62,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763507,brightOtter,2020-04-28T02:48:02.705Z,"Considering the son's partner is capable of speaking English, I think it's inconsiderate to only speak French knowing their mother in law cannot understand. "
62,0,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,excitedBear,2020-04-28T02:48:08.928Z,Exactly. I agree
62,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762441,inspiredBison,2020-04-28T02:48:21.656Z,Couldn't she have just asked them to speak English?
62,0,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,excitedBear,2020-04-28T02:48:30.566Z,"They might not have realized it was rude, but I think the fact that he stormed off after she asked them to speak English is an overreaction"
62,0,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,excitedBear,2020-04-28T02:48:36.095Z,She did
62,0,5d482ea521c9be351f76263c,inquisitiveHorse,2020-04-28T02:49:09.083Z,This could be written by his father too
62,0,5d482ea521c9be351f76272d,novelCamel,2020-04-28T02:49:14.131Z,"I think the mom is being an asshole.  If they wanted to include her in the conversation then they would speak in English, clearly they didnt want her in the conversation at that time.  "
62,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762441,inspiredBison,2020-04-28T02:49:23.253Z,He just left the room. That isn't exactly storming off. I think they were just talking naturally and didn't realize it would bother her.
62,0,5d482ea721c9be351f76300d,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:49:45.721Z,"It is definitely a rude gesture, but I don't think that he is an asshole. "
62,0,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,excitedBear,2020-04-28T02:49:48.245Z,"The inlaw is allowing them to stay in their home, presuming for free. If they don't want to include him/her, then speak about whatever that is at another time"
62,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763507,brightOtter,2020-04-28T02:49:52.830Z,"I think the parent probably could have brought up the situation in a nicer way, but they're right in being annoyed by it in my opinion "
62,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762441,inspiredBison,2020-04-28T02:50:07.540Z,I agree brightOtter
62,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763507,brightOtter,2020-04-28T02:50:08.081Z,The son and his partner could easily just speak French when alone together 
62,0,5d482ea521c9be351f76263c,inquisitiveHorse,2020-04-28T02:50:15.888Z,Yeah its definitely borderline.  Really depends on the tone and feel of what happened which is hard to guess from the narrative.
62,0,5d482ea521c9be351f76272d,novelCamel,2020-04-28T02:50:28.049Z,I dont think just because you are allowing someone to stay in your home that it means that they have to be included in every conversation...
62,0,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,excitedBear,2020-04-28T02:50:29.286Z,"Exactly. And if they're talking about something they don't want to discuss with him/her, it's even more rude tbh"
62,0,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,excitedBear,2020-04-28T02:50:57.981Z,"Including in every conversation is one thing, but if they're constantly in the same room and constantly leaving them out, that's another thing"
62,0,5d482ea721c9be351f76300d,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:51:00.905Z,They might have been having a private conversation and did not think about including anyone though.  But he did react a little childish to her calling him out on it.
62,0,5d482ea521c9be351f76263c,inquisitiveHorse,2020-04-28T02:51:07.446Z,I tend to agree that the parent (mother or father) was unnecessarily left out.  And it leans toward rude on the son and husband's part.
62,0,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,excitedBear,2020-04-28T02:51:17.990Z,"If it was a one-off situation, sure, but it sounds like this was constant."
62,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763507,brightOtter,2020-04-28T02:51:21.871Z,"You shouldn't have to be included in every conversation just because you're allowing someone to stay with you, but consideration and common sense should be used. The partner and son are outright excluding the parent completely"
62,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762441,inspiredBison,2020-04-28T02:51:25.578Z,"If this is the normal way that they communicate with each other, then I think it was just natural. I don't think they were intentionally trying to keep her from listening."
62,0,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,excitedBear,2020-04-28T02:51:49.139Z,Agreed. I think the overreaction from the partner is uncalled for.
62,0,5d482ea521c9be351f76272d,novelCamel,2020-04-28T02:51:51.316Z,I think the man was probably just more comfortable speaking his own language and maybe didnt even think anything of it
62,0,5d482ea721c9be351f76300d,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:51:54.566Z,So who are we deciding is an asshole or not?  The mom or the partner?
62,0,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,excitedBear,2020-04-28T02:52:07.587Z,I think the son and partner are.
62,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762441,inspiredBison,2020-04-28T02:52:09.156Z,"While it would be frustrating to not understand them, I don't think I would get mad. I would just ask them to speak English."
62,0,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,excitedBear,2020-04-28T02:52:11.244Z,Although barely lol
62,0,5d482ea521c9be351f76263c,inquisitiveHorse,2020-04-28T02:52:13.274Z,mom or father.  we don't know the gender of the narrator!
62,0,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,excitedBear,2020-04-28T02:53:03.530Z,I voted no.
62,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763507,brightOtter,2020-04-28T02:53:08.534Z,"I don't think the parent is the asshole. If i was staying in someone's home I would make an effort to include them in conversation, and speak in the language they are most comfortable in using as it's their home"
62,0,5d482ea521c9be351f76263c,inquisitiveHorse,2020-04-28T02:53:23.808Z,Same.  
62,0,5d482ea521c9be351f76272d,novelCamel,2020-04-28T02:53:33.763Z,"I voted yes because I think the parent overreacted, there was no ill will"
62,0,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,excitedBear,2020-04-28T02:53:38.572Z,"Yeah, I've been the partner staying with parents. I'm always trying to be respectful and nice."
62,0,5d482ea721c9be351f76300d,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:53:41.795Z,Ok.  So I don't think the parent is an asshole either.
62,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762441,inspiredBison,2020-04-28T02:53:41.824Z,I think they weren't thinking about how it looked and just acting naturally. I think the mother could have easily mentioned that she didn't understand. She instead acted rude. I think the mom was the asshole
62,1,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,delightedBison,2020-04-28T03:02:20.580Z,"How hard is it to warn your mother that your partner is self-conscious about his accent, etc?"
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76272d,novelElephant,2020-04-28T03:02:25.724Z,I do not this she is being an asshole
62,1,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,delightedBison,2020-04-28T03:02:40.326Z,I think they're all assholes.
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762441,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T03:02:41.795Z,I think he should explain how his boyfriend feels to his mother. I am sure she could reassure him that they wouldn't judge him.
62,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76300d,curiousBear,2020-04-28T03:02:45.592Z,I do not think that the son is being an asshole but they should have discussed this beforehand.
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76272d,novelElephant,2020-04-28T03:03:01.144Z,"She is doing what is best for her and her partner, and that is not being an asshole.  She can catch her mother up at any time in English."
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76263c,eagerZebra,2020-04-28T03:03:02.400Z,"Exactly, the scenario does not say he told his mother about his husband's discomfort."
62,1,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,delightedBison,2020-04-28T03:03:06.333Z,"Yeah, it just doesn't seem like something that should have been an issue, considering it was a previously-addressed issue."
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76272d,novelElephant,2020-04-28T03:03:12.776Z,Or she can translate while they are talking so her mother feels included.
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76263c,eagerZebra,2020-04-28T03:03:28.832Z,If he explained to his mother and she still insists it is a different matter.  But it doesnt say he did.
62,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763507,livelyHippo,2020-04-28T03:03:30.140Z,"Although I think the child has no ill will towards the mother in this situation, I think they should have just told the mother about the husband being uncomfortable. "
62,1,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,delightedBison,2020-04-28T03:03:42.531Z,Yes. Communication is key.
62,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76300d,curiousBear,2020-04-28T03:03:50.883Z,I understand wanting your partner feeling comfortable being in your parent's house so if they all would have discussed this this would not be an issue at all.
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76272d,novelElephant,2020-04-28T03:03:53.969Z,yes they should have just communicated better
62,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763507,livelyHippo,2020-04-28T03:03:55.055Z,It's the difference between someone being uncomfortable vs someone being completely excluded. One is better than the other
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762441,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T03:03:59.799Z,"If he didn't speak any English I would understand, but he does speak English. I think she would understand if he messed up."
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76272d,novelElephant,2020-04-28T03:04:03.828Z,nobody is being an asshole on purpose
62,1,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,delightedBison,2020-04-28T03:04:07.581Z,"I I think ""asshole"" is a strong word, but the lack of comminication sorta makes them the ""bad guy"""
62,1,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,delightedBison,2020-04-28T03:04:23.763Z,"Exactly, no one is being an asshole on purpose."
62,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763507,livelyHippo,2020-04-28T03:04:24.471Z,Intent isn't what were debating though either. We're talking about actions 
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76263c,eagerZebra,2020-04-28T03:04:30.441Z,Agreed.  He is the asshole because he just needed to communicate and set expectations instead of letting his mother - who is being kind enough to host them - feel excluded.
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762441,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T03:04:30.520Z,To automatically not consider your mother's situation is rude. 
62,1,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,delightedBison,2020-04-28T03:04:34.462Z,"Actionwise, I guess.yes. Asshole."
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762441,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T03:05:17.509Z,I think this could have easily been taken care of if the son talked with his mother and spouse. 
62,1,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,delightedBison,2020-04-28T03:05:30.299Z,"Yep. And if the spouse really wanted to talk in German, translate for your mother."
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76263c,eagerZebra,2020-04-28T03:05:32.181Z,yep
62,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763507,livelyHippo,2020-04-28T03:05:38.649Z,I think if the partner spoke no english it would be more up for debate. But at the end of the day you're completely excluding your parent (whose home you're staying at) 
62,1,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,delightedBison,2020-04-28T03:05:40.211Z,She is being nice enough to host and cook. She misses you. Include her.
62,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76300d,curiousBear,2020-04-28T03:05:45.961Z,I don't think speaking in his partner's native language makes you an asshole. 
62,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763507,livelyHippo,2020-04-28T03:05:58.080Z,"Exactly, the spouse could help with the whole ""not knowing the right word"" "
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762441,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T03:06:05.388Z,If they are in a realtionship the mother will never get to know him if they aren't able to communicate. 
62,1,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,delightedBison,2020-04-28T03:06:05.528Z,But it's not the mother staying with THEM. She's hosting them and she's being excluded.
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76272d,novelElephant,2020-04-28T03:06:10.196Z,"I also think that the parent seems a little insecure and there is a bit of a power struggle going on, but thats just an opinion"
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76263c,eagerZebra,2020-04-28T03:06:21.323Z,"Possibly, but she is hosting them and they are the guests and they should try to be polite and considerate to her foremost while in her home."
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76272d,novelElephant,2020-04-28T03:06:24.926Z,"and maybe thats why that parent is so ""hurt"" about this"
62,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763507,livelyHippo,2020-04-28T03:06:30.463Z,You're still excluding someone needlessly 
62,1,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,delightedBison,2020-04-28T03:06:47.755Z,"Yep. Even if he could ONLY speak German, you'd still want to include mom by translating."
62,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763507,livelyHippo,2020-04-28T03:07:12.472Z,"Is it better to make sure someone is 100% comfortable or exclude someone else completely? Because, for me, exclusion is worse than making someone uncomfortable"
62,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762441,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T03:07:17.099Z,It would be hard for the mother to get to know him without communication. Even bad English would help them to get to know each other and feel comfortable. 
62,1,5ea6382c7c882f6974ff31e4,delightedBison,2020-04-28T03:07:18.017Z,I'll be voting asshole. lol

63,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762bac,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T02:58:21.060Z,"It sounds like she calls him at random times, when she is in the store. "

63,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76242c,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:58:33.063Z,"right, not calling him all the time"
63,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76238f,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T02:58:35.397Z,"I can see how his frustrations came through in his post venting, but I think he should have had a clearer discussion with his wife before getting angry with her mother"
63,1,5ea78bbe21028d2296a48d8c,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T02:58:45.951Z,I don't think she is calling him all hours of the day or anything
63,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76242c,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:58:46.998Z,"I think he's an asshole, although he isnt totally wrong"
63,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762d8e,inspiredBison,2020-04-28T02:58:47.237Z,I agree about the discussion.
63,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76242d,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:58:49.897Z,He also married this girl and with that comes responsibilities/burdens to help her/her family
63,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762bac,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T02:59:00.353Z,I think both sides are overreacting. There is a middle ground.
63,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762d8e,inspiredBison,2020-04-28T02:59:02.783Z,He didn't marry to translate for the in laws
63,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762d8e,inspiredBison,2020-04-28T02:59:08.679Z,there isa middle grounds
63,1,5d482ea421c9be351f762324,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:59:08.905Z,But marrying into a family that he knew to begin with didn't speak English is something that has to be considered. It's not like he didn't know what he was getting into.
63,1,5ea78bbe21028d2296a48d8c,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T02:59:16.528Z,"Yeah, he outlined that in his post, that he knew most of his wife's family were immigrants and spoke Spanisg"

63,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76242d,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:59:35.773Z,It's not like he is translating for her 24/7

63,1,5ea78bbe21028d2296a48d8c,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T02:59:40.040Z,exactly
63,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76242c,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:59:40.099Z,it isnt like she only depends on him...he seems more frustrated that she doesn't know english more so than her calling all the time
63,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76238f,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T02:59:56.657Z,"He doesn't say that he thinks it is a full time job, just that it is annoying"

63,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76242d,openOtter,2020-04-28T03:00:21.419Z,Yeah he is frustrated she knows English. He taught himself Spanish so he thinks everyone can learn every language as easy as he did. That's definitely NOT the case. He's an asshole.
63,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76242d,openOtter,2020-04-28T03:00:34.518Z,doesn't know English*
63,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76238f,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T03:00:39.497Z,Yes he is the asshole
63,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762bac,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T03:00:54.005Z,He is an asshole. He needs sympathy for her. She's his MIL and he says he loves her.
63,1,5d482ea421c9be351f762324,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T03:01:02.423Z,He sounds like an asshole to me

64,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76300a,openGorilla,2020-04-28T02:50:41.547Z,i think that he should not have blown up at his mother in law like that. he could have said it in a nicer way and been easier on her. she's an old woman and it's harder for her to understand and learn english than it is for him. 
64,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76290a,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T02:50:44.762Z,I believe he is being an asshole. 
64,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a5e,eagerHorse,2020-04-28T02:50:48.292Z,I first thought while reading this that I am on the original poster's side because she has been living here for 8 years so she should make an effort.
64,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762725,novelDolphin,2020-04-28T02:51:02.256Z,Yes i am leaning that he is an asshole as well
64,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:51:06.398Z,There's not much evidence that OP lashed out to the mom it seems like he's venting
64,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:51:16.446Z,Why is OP is asshole?
64,1,5ea75f18fd339b022f9cebb0,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T02:51:17.317Z,He is disrespectful and should be happy to help his mother in law. I've heard english is the hardest to learn.
64,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:51:47.770Z,Is it unreasonable to seek to minimize on demand calls for translation?
64,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a5e,eagerHorse,2020-04-28T02:51:54.346Z,I can see that it would be difficult for her to learn English for sure.
64,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762725,novelDolphin,2020-04-28T02:51:54.772Z,he probably wasn't the only one helping out his MIL

64,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762725,novelDolphin,2020-04-28T02:52:20.756Z,they didn't say how much of the time the calls were
64,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762725,novelDolphin,2020-04-28T02:52:37.184Z,it could have been once a month for a couple of minutes or something like that
64,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a5e,eagerHorse,2020-04-28T02:52:39.388Z,I do think he could have said it in a nicer way.
64,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:52:42.917Z,Did you read the edit? It sounds like OP made a polite request to tell the mother to learn English
64,1,5ea75f18fd339b022f9cebb0,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T02:53:00.617Z,I  agree he did have to be so rude.
64,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762725,novelDolphin,2020-04-28T02:53:10.018Z,was this happening every day?
64,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a5e,eagerHorse,2020-04-28T02:53:20.195Z,Overall I do not think he is being an asshole because she is relying on him.
64,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:53:32.103Z,"Regardless of frequency, OP expresses frustration with the situation and seeks to amend it. He did it in a reasonable fashion"
64,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76290a,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T02:53:49.455Z,its hard to come to a country and learn there culture and there language. yes its been 8 years but there is no proof that she is not trying to learn. maybe its a confidence issue with her. 
64,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:53:50.740Z,If you were in his shoes what would you do?
64,1,5ea75f18fd339b022f9cebb0,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T02:53:57.757Z,I dont think asking anybody in anyway to learn english is polite. so considering both side I still think he is an asshole
64,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:54:08.120Z,"He didn't demand the mother to instantly know English, he pointed out resources for her"
64,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76290a,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T02:54:17.945Z,I whould help her learn without an insulting her
64,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7626d5,curiousBear,2020-04-28T02:54:24.879Z,i also think he is not being an asshole and it could be frustrating having to be the 
64,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76290a,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T02:54:43.904Z,not everyone is able to learn from an app
64,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:55:00.448Z,He provides multiple resources including in person classes
64,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:55:11.749Z,I do not think it is rude to ask someone to learn English
64,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762725,novelDolphin,2020-04-28T02:55:21.962Z,he could have offered to taught her english himself
64,1,5ea75f18fd339b022f9cebb0,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T02:55:33.647Z,Ive taking 4 years of spanish and still cant speak or understand it fluently so I can see why she hasnt learned it yet

64,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a5e,eagerHorse,2020-04-28T02:55:51.353Z,I do not think he is being an asshole about it.
64,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:55:52.929Z,OP is not asking the mother to become fluent in English
64,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76290a,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T02:55:56.704Z,its tough and Im sure she is trying to learn
64,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7626d5,curiousBear,2020-04-28T02:56:01.181Z,i agreed with delightedGiraffe 
64,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:56:03.093Z,The mother is asking for simple translations

64,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762725,novelDolphin,2020-04-28T02:56:07.754Z,it is tough
64,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:56:26.585Z,"The mother does not need to become fluent in English to understand simple translations, such as ones you can ask over the phone"
64,3,5d482ea721c9be351f76300a,eagerElephant,2020-04-28T03:20:06.386Z,he's being disrecptful to her mother. she's an older woman and can't learn as.easy as someone younger might. it doens't take much out of your day to help her out for 10 minutes.
64,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,brightHorse,2020-04-28T03:20:11.724Z,"I said the husband's perspective was NTA, but I also see the wife's situation is NTA as well"
64,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,brightHorse,2020-04-28T03:20:23.263Z,It is reasonable to see both perspectives as NTA
64,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762725,openZebra,2020-04-28T03:20:33.759Z,it's tough
64,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762a5e,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T03:20:33.821Z,I think the original poster is being unreasonable forcing him to translate but I can see both sides.
64,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,brightHorse,2020-04-28T03:20:50.618Z,openZebra what's tough
64,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7626d5,lightDolphin,2020-04-28T03:20:50.907Z,i agree with the husband to a certain extend that it is not his responsibility for being a translator for his mother in law. 
64,3,5ea75f18fd339b022f9cebb0,delightedBear,2020-04-28T03:20:51.977Z,Well she should have asked her husband before making him the family translator but I understand she doesnt have time. 
64,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7626d5,lightDolphin,2020-04-28T03:20:58.306Z,And the family being in the US for so long should have learn some 
64,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762725,openZebra,2020-04-28T03:21:02.223Z,i meant the issue is tough because i can see both sides
64,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762a5e,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T03:21:11.381Z,I think he should not have a problem with translating especially if he has more time. 
64,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76290a,excitedGorilla,2020-04-28T03:21:12.865Z,No hes not the asshole but his husband is he knew what he was marrying into

64,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762725,openZebra,2020-04-28T03:22:08.039Z,i could see both sides not being an asshole
64,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76290a,excitedGorilla,2020-04-28T03:22:16.496Z,your family is first and you should be willing to help them anyway you can even if its as something as small as translating for them
64,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762a5e,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T03:22:25.396Z,He should be more understanding but she should also not sign him up for things.
64,3,5ea75f18fd339b022f9cebb0,delightedBear,2020-04-28T03:22:33.157Z,I think they both have equal arguments I can see where they are both coming from.
64,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762725,openZebra,2020-04-28T03:22:38.547Z,if family is first shouldn't the daughter be translating more for the mother?
64,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,brightHorse,2020-04-28T03:22:39.943Z,Yes I agree

64,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,brightHorse,2020-04-28T03:24:55.418Z,Ok then we are at consensus
64,3,5ea75f18fd339b022f9cebb0,delightedBear,2020-04-28T03:25:49.657Z,No
64,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763292,brightHorse,2020-04-28T03:26:04.360Z,1 person voted yes smh
65,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762852,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-28T02:45:57.779Z,"Initially I thought he was NTA because he has chosen to put his spouse above his mother, which is how things should be ordered. "
65,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762b47,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:46:16.949Z,"It seems to me that the mother is doing a lot to make her son and his husband comfortable, so they should reciprocrate and make her comfortable too, especially since the husband can speak English."
65,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76278b,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:46:34.557Z,It is definitely rude to stay at your parents house and not speak their language most of the time. The husband knows some English and it sounds like the mom knows no German at all.
65,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762852,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-28T02:46:50.701Z,"However, they are staying in her home, so they could be more respectful and try to accomodate her wishes. "
65,1,5ea733123ecdad55472021a0,inquisitiveGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:46:56.043Z,"idk both sides should just work it out. I think that the husband should speak. You also can't be a ""asshole"" in this type of situation."
65,1,5ea731503ecdad5547201baf,novelBear,2020-04-28T02:47:19.291Z,I think it's unreasonable to ask for every conversation to be in English. But it's also unreasonable to never speak in English.
65,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76278b,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:47:32.340Z,"Asshole is definitely a strong word for this. It is inconsiderate to the mom, no doubt."
65,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762b47,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:47:42.938Z,"maybe it is hard to say he is definitely being an asshole, but it is rude to speak a language not everyone speaks, if all parties can communicate in a certain language"
65,1,5ea731503ecdad5547201baf,novelBear,2020-04-28T02:47:45.978Z,"I think the mother wants every conversation in English but the daughter wants just some in English, some in German, which is more reasonable."
65,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762852,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-28T02:47:47.442Z,"Yes if she can't speak a lick of German and the husband can speak some English, this is a great opportunity for him to practice English and make mom happy!"
65,1,5ea733123ecdad55472021a0,inquisitiveGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:48:19.050Z,The husband should just deal with it for a little
65,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762b47,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:48:29.807Z,That is a good point to see it as an opportunity to practice English
65,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76278b,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:48:35.081Z,"They're with the mom for one weekend, the couple will be together for the foreseeable future. They should make the mom happy for the time being."
65,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762852,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-28T02:48:44.611Z,"He definitely doesn't seem like TA, but I do think they could make more of an effort to speak English around mom. "
65,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762852,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-28T02:49:10.920Z,They can always speak German when in private and English around mom. 
65,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762b47,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:49:25.569Z,"There is definitely no reason not to speak German in their own conversations, but should speak English with the mother"
65,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76278b,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:50:48.111Z,"I'm going to pick asshole, because above all the mom is the host so they should respect her wishes if they're reasonable. "
65,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762852,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-28T02:51:24.086Z,"I vote he is inconsiderate, but not TA. "
65,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762b47,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:51:34.490Z,I agree since a choice has to be made I'd say asshole because it is rude to her when she is being accomodating to them
65,3,5ea731503ecdad5547201baf,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-04-28T03:15:33.110Z,"She sounds reasonable, the daughter can simply say no, I'd rather not."
65,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762852,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T03:16:01.249Z,Are we asking if the mom is the asshole or the son?
65,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762b47,openCamel,2020-04-28T03:16:04.664Z,"It does seem to me if everyone can speak English, but the mother can't speak French, if they are all together they should speak English"
65,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762b47,openCamel,2020-04-28T03:16:07.233Z,the mom
65,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76278b,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T03:16:08.960Z,"Yeah this one seems pretty simple, I don't see anything asshole-ish about asking your guests to speak your language in front of you if they're able to."
65,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762852,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T03:16:23.211Z,"Ok, I don't think the mom is the asshole here at all then. "
65,3,5ea731503ecdad5547201baf,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-04-28T03:16:26.028Z,"I think the daughter can say no if she wants to, but that doesn't make the mom an asshole"
65,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762852,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T03:16:41.059Z,"If they can all speak English, then they should respect the host. "
65,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762b47,openCamel,2020-04-28T03:16:50.946Z,"It might have been more constructive to just start a conversation in English instead of calling them disrespectful, but it does seem the son was being rude"
65,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762852,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T03:17:05.291Z,"I agree...she's allowed to make her own choices, but that hardly makes mom the bad guy here. "
65,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762852,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T03:17:13.458Z,I think she just wants to be part of the conversation. 
65,3,5ea733123ecdad55472021a0,livelyZebra,2020-04-28T03:17:18.955Z,Yes this person is such an asshole.
65,3,5ea733123ecdad55472021a0,livelyZebra,2020-04-28T03:17:55.554Z,Why would you be so mean to someone that doesn't know English. It is not like you would talk shit about your own person.
65,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762b47,openCamel,2020-04-28T03:17:55.758Z,It sounds like we all agree the mom was completely within her rights
65,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762852,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T03:18:27.282Z,"Well according to what she said, he does speak English. He just chose not to. "
65,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762852,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T03:21:03.795Z,I believe the mom was not TA in this situation. 
65,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76278b,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T03:21:23.699Z,"The way I look at it, if you're letting someone stay at your house you'd have to be pretty darn rude to be considered an asshole. This isn't even close to that."
65,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762b47,openCamel,2020-04-28T03:21:53.243Z,"I agree the mom just wanted to be included, plus was being hospitable to them"
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763229,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:55:10.057Z,"I'm thinking that OP probably isn't speaking german 100% of the time, it sounds like she's asking him not to speak it at all which seems kinda mean"
66,2,5d482ea921c9be351f76366e,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:55:13.650Z,"I think she's not an asshole, but she could have been more helpful to her husband and to her mom."
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7631bd,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-28T02:55:28.502Z,"I don't think the guy is an asshole, he is being rude though by excluding his mother. But that doesn't necessarily make him an asshole as he's doing it to make his husband more comfortable"
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630b3,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:55:34.046Z,This guy's not an asshole by any stretch of the imagination: he just got married and his mother's expecting his partner to have picked up English to a conversational level
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7634a7,excitedElephant,2020-04-28T02:55:55.463Z,It seems unfair of the writer to choose to speak German when his mom can understand none of the conversation but his spouse could understand at least some of the conversation if they were speaking English
66,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f97,inquisitiveBear,2020-04-28T02:56:07.917Z,It's the mother's home and she is being excluded. The husband can speak English but gets nervous. The mother can't speak German at all though. 
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7634a7,excitedElephant,2020-04-28T02:56:13.062Z,"Plus, his mom is graciously hosting them. It seems rude to be to exclude her. "
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763229,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:56:33.340Z,Wouldn't mom just need to ask what they're talking about tho?
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7631bd,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-28T02:56:36.936Z,But is he being an asshole? I still say no. Just a rude SOB 
66,2,5d482ea921c9be351f76366e,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:56:37.551Z,It is rather rude to speak German in the mother's house when she doesn't speak it.
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7631bd,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-28T02:56:50.989Z,"The husband speaks English too, so they can all speak English"
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630b3,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:56:55.866Z,Yeah it may be rude but its not assholish
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763229,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:56:56.701Z,they 99% aren't likely talking shit about mom
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763229,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:57:10.989Z,but not to a conversational level
66,2,5d482ea921c9be351f76366e,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:57:25.055Z,The Mom and child could both help him with his English to make him more comfortable.
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7634a7,excitedElephant,2020-04-28T02:57:27.839Z,THere seems to be little compromise here. The newlyweds could always have their private conversations in German and speak English when mom is around. 
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7631bd,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-28T02:57:38.481Z,exactly excitedElephant
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763229,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:57:43.242Z,"Yeah, and even a little german when mom is around should be fine IMO"
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763229,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:57:50.360Z,she shouldn't have to know every single thing
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630b3,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:58:02.363Z,Or the guy can spend some time with his mother apart to relate all that's happened
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763229,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:58:08.880Z,Definitely
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630b3,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:58:29.969Z,I may not be married but even I know spouses arent joined at the hip
66,2,5d482ea921c9be351f76366e,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:58:35.589Z,"I think they're being rude to the Mother, but not necessarily an asshole."
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763229,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:58:44.519Z,so I think we all agree NTA?
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7634a7,excitedElephant,2020-04-28T02:58:46.846Z,"Besides, what a great way to learn conversational English that he might not be familiar with....with his new spouse and mother in law. That's as non judgemental of a crowd as you can find. "
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7634a7,excitedElephant,2020-04-28T02:58:53.694Z,"I agree, NTA. Just kinda rude. "
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7631bd,fulfilledMonkey,2020-04-28T02:58:58.450Z,Yeah NTA. There's no asshole here
66,2,5d482ea921c9be351f76366e,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:59:04.780Z,"Yes, NTA"
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630b3,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:59:16.037Z,"Ehhh mother in laws can be a tough crowd, especially for a M/M pair"
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630b3,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:59:22.818Z,"still, no assholes here"
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7634a7,excitedElephant,2020-04-28T02:59:59.701Z,"True, eagerCamel though there's nothing in the writing that suggests that's the case here. "
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630b3,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T03:00:20.256Z,I'm American (25M) and recently married a German guy (23M)
66,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630b3,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T03:00:29.203Z,thats the first line
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630b3,curiousBison,2020-04-28T03:09:53.847Z,This AITA feels like it was written by a narcissist
66,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76366e,livelyZebra,2020-04-28T03:10:00.958Z,It's her house and his husband speaks English. 
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7634a7,novelDolphin,2020-04-28T03:10:15.680Z,I feel like mainly she was just super rude
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631bd,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T03:10:18.482Z,I think the mother had a normal reaction as far as being excluded from the conversation. She could have engaged the son-in-law in English conversation instead of being rude though
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763229,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-28T03:10:24.589Z, might be a bit too much to ask someone who's clearly not comfortable speaking english to speak it. Can't she just chill for a week?
66,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76366e,livelyZebra,2020-04-28T03:10:54.619Z,"I think the son in law was the rude one. He can speak English, but chose not to with her in the room."
66,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f97,fulfilledHippo,2020-04-28T03:10:56.357Z,She could have just said something to the son without the partner present. 
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630b3,curiousBison,2020-04-28T03:11:24.677Z,I've met people like this - no. If people don't behave exactly as they expect they fly off the handle
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763229,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-28T03:11:26.471Z,Maybe because he wants to make his partner more comfortable @Zebra?
66,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76366e,livelyZebra,2020-04-28T03:11:40.641Z,"""My son’s partner is French, but he can speak English, he just has an accent."" Maybe the son-in "

66,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76366e,livelyZebra,2020-04-28T03:12:05.987Z,"-Maybe the son-in-law is uncomfortable, but she can help him."
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763229,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-28T03:12:12.881Z,"but OP also says he spoke very few english sentences since he got there, that's a pretty good sign he's not good at it"
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630b3,curiousBison,2020-04-28T03:12:55.301Z,There's a difference between being conversational in english and knowing the absolute basics
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631bd,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T03:12:56.374Z,"The son's partner is just used to speaking French and made little attempt to speak English, knowing the mother doesn't know French. Kind of lazy and rude too"
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631bd,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T03:13:25.557Z,The French are known for being English-phobic lol

66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763229,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-28T03:13:37.608Z,wow way to stereotype bro
66,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f97,fulfilledHippo,2020-04-28T03:13:42.361Z,They were rude and so was she but nobody was an asshole here. 
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631bd,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T03:13:50.735Z,I wouldn't call her an asshole
66,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76366e,livelyZebra,2020-04-28T03:13:53.091Z,@lightMonkey Agree with being rude and lazy.
66,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76366e,livelyZebra,2020-04-28T03:14:27.902Z,I don't think she was being an asshole either. 
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7634a7,novelDolphin,2020-04-28T03:14:31.860Z,I kind of want to call her the asshole in this scenario. She could have approached the conversation a bunch of different ways that would likely have turned out better. 
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763229,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-28T03:14:34.230Z,How is it lazy to not instantly get good at a second language?
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631bd,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T03:14:48.453Z,"She said he knows English, just has an accent"
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7630b3,curiousBison,2020-04-28T03:14:56.108Z,I would-  this person seems like the type to laugh if the partner's english was no good
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763229,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-28T03:15:00.816Z,"Yes, she said that, but I don't think she would be the best judge of that."

66,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f97,fulfilledHippo,2020-04-28T03:15:34.461Z,Instead of stomping upstairs he could have just apologized to her and tried to speak a little bit to include her. 
66,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76366e,livelyZebra,2020-04-28T03:15:45.288Z,"I'm not sure I know enough about her to know what ""type"" of person she is just from this one situation."
66,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631bd,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T03:16:03.023Z,livelyZebra thats more reasonable thinking than most
66,3,5d482ea921c9be351f76366e,livelyZebra,2020-04-28T03:16:19.322Z,I think she's not an asshole
67,0,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:16:56.205Z,Should her mother have to learn english?
67,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7633c1,novelMonkey,2020-04-28T02:17:17.071Z,"Possibly, but maybe he should have had his wife talk to mother in law"
67,0,5ea788e421028d2296a48cb8,brightGorilla,2020-04-28T02:17:32.327Z,I think the point is he's just tired of being translator. 
67,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763358,lightBison,2020-04-28T02:17:32.957Z,I agree he should not be the translator
67,0,5ea19fe2de5d74641b66c67a,openGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:17:48.684Z,I CAN UNDERSTAND HIS FRUSTRATION AND I DONT TRANSLATE FOR PEOPLE
67,0,5ea75dc4fd339b022f9ceb9c,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:17:52.219Z,I understand his frustration but don't think he should be the one to tell his mother in law that she needs to learn english.
67,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7633c1,novelMonkey,2020-04-28T02:17:55.691Z,"or possibly said I may not be available all the time when you need me so i will help you learn english, instead of saying it's frustrating"
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:17:56.006Z,"I think that what he did was realistic and respectful, but it's not an approach that's likely to be interpreted well in the current climate."

67,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7633c1,novelMonkey,2020-04-28T02:18:08.759Z,exactly
67,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T02:18:13.832Z,"""Have"" to learn English is extreme but be encouraged to learn, perhaps?"
67,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7633c1,novelMonkey,2020-04-28T02:18:21.131Z,I think he
67,0,5ea19fe2de5d74641b66c67a,openGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:18:24.904Z,HOW DID HE TELL HER THAT IF SHE CANT SPEAK ENGLIS
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:18:30.844Z,"I think since he knew her for 8 years, and loves her, and the family, and has the respect to speak Spanish, she could be encouraged that he would help her with English."
67,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T02:18:37.757Z,He's bilingual.

67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:18:41.501Z,Open openGiraffe he speaks fluent Spanish.
67,0,5ea75dc4fd339b022f9ceb9c,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:18:43.032Z,"He does seem a little 'braggadocios' though, language does not come easy for everyone and English is particularly hard"
67,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763358,lightBison,2020-04-28T02:18:50.920Z,He speaks spanish as well
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:18:54.143Z,It sounds like he's willing to help her.
67,0,5ea19fe2de5d74641b66c67a,openGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:18:57.076Z,OH YEAH
67,0,5ea19fe2de5d74641b66c67a,openGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:19:00.304Z,I FORGOT
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:19:06.060Z,If we can all have languages in common we can get along better. 
67,0,5ea788e421028d2296a48cb8,brightGorilla,2020-04-28T02:19:08.336Z,I don't think he's an asshole... I think the situation itself just sucks 
67,0,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:19:08.621Z,Yeah I do not know what to say I would not make a good juror between them
67,0,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:19:18.854Z,I don't think he is racist though
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:19:19.711Z,It doesn't mean don't speak other languages.
67,0,5ea19fe2de5d74641b66c67a,openGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:19:20.715Z,I REALLY DO THINK SHE SHOULD PUT FORTH SOME EFFORT
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:19:25.094Z,I don't think he is racist.
67,0,5ea75dc4fd339b022f9ceb9c,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:19:33.147Z,The way he wrote the scenario definitely makes him seem like an asshole - but his edit at the bottom seems more like he didn't say things so cruel.
67,0,5ea19fe2de5d74641b66c67a,openGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:19:36.420Z,BUT NOT EVERYONE CAN LEARN THAT MANY LANGUAGES
67,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7633c1,novelMonkey,2020-04-28T02:19:37.131Z,"This is  tough one, i think he is right to feel the way he does, just took the wrong approach"
67,0,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:19:39.755Z,maybe a little wifeisct
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:19:41.677Z,I think if he went to another country he woudl learn the language.
67,0,5ea75dc4fd339b022f9ceb9c,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:19:51.966Z,i agree novelMonkey
67,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T02:19:54.365Z,"Having been in a similar situation, it is an extremely challenging situation."
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:19:57.466Z,"It's hard, but she could start with basic phrases."
67,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763358,lightBison,2020-04-28T02:20:03.231Z,after 8 years you should be somewhat familiar with the language
67,0,5ea788e421028d2296a48cb8,brightGorilla,2020-04-28T02:20:10.107Z,She likely already knows basic phrases after eight years
67,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T02:20:22.553Z,"But, if it"
67,0,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:20:23.410Z,A racist trump supportor that does hold a lot of weight though
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:20:23.968Z,I think we also need to know that there might be a lot more goin on with her than we are aware of.
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:20:26.636Z,Past trauam.
67,0,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:20:28.736Z,I am just kidding
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:20:28.957Z,Illness.
67,0,5ea75dc4fd339b022f9ceb9c,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:20:32.646Z,i have a feeling she was relying on him so much she felt like she didn't need to learn more.
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:20:36.670Z,Unclear what else might be getting in her way.
67,0,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:20:44.845Z,to many chiefs not enough engines
67,0,5ea788e421028d2296a48cb8,brightGorilla,2020-04-28T02:20:46.769Z,Can't teach an old dog new tricks 
67,0,5ea75dc4fd339b022f9ceb9c,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:20:49.005Z,Older generations can also be stubborn.
67,0,5ea788e421028d2296a48cb8,brightGorilla,2020-04-28T02:20:49.611Z,how old are they?
67,0,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:20:53.151Z,I want to be an engine!!!
67,0,5ea19fe2de5d74641b66c67a,openGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:20:53.711Z,I DID CONSIDER BOTH SIDES AND MAYBE JUST PUR FORTH SOME EFFORT ON HER SIDE AND MAYBE HE SHOULD TRY TO TEACHJ HER
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:20:55.497Z,Or she may expect him to help because he's the husband of her daughter.
67,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T02:21:04.205Z,If it's not necessary for her to speak English (other than by his demands) what is the concern?
67,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763358,lightBison,2020-04-28T02:21:09.377Z,He said he would teach her
67,0,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:21:22.724Z,I would tell the judge I have to be excused cause of conflict of interests lol
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:21:28.774Z,He is getting called up at random times to help her.  It's not that he doesn't want to help.
67,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7633c1,novelMonkey,2020-04-28T02:21:39.190Z,I think hispanic cultures are so much more family oriented that she probably doesn't understand why he feels this way
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:21:40.540Z,Maybe they could work out a schedule?
67,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T02:21:49.150Z,Sometimes our elders are set in their ways and not willing to learn new things.
67,0,5ea75dc4fd339b022f9ceb9c,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:21:50.654Z,It's a very inconvenient thing for him and she shouldn't 'expect' him to do that for her
67,0,5ea19fe2de5d74641b66c67a,openGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:21:56.047Z,HE IS THE CONCERN AND I UNDERSTAND HIS FRUSTRATION
67,0,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:21:58.560Z,I would always translate for her cause i love her its my woman
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:22:09.211Z,I don't think it has to do wtih being family oriented.  Italians are extremely family oriented and they learned English when they came here.
67,0,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:22:12.497Z,well unless i did not love her then lol
67,0,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:22:20.022Z,he is an asshole
67,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T02:22:22.051Z,I think his concern is getting lost in translation.
67,0,5ea75dc4fd339b022f9ceb9c,eagerCamel,2020-04-28T02:22:32.306Z,I feel like he's a slight asshole...but do understand his frustration.
67,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763358,lightBison,2020-04-28T02:22:49.878Z,I believe that is not a asshole his mother n law needs to learn the language
67,0,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:22:54.022Z,thanks for hanging out with me all of you.. 
67,0,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:23:01.344Z,I think i can be a asshole sometimes
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:23:04.776Z,"I don't think he's an asshole, he just should have approached it differently.  Yes, his concern is getting lost in translation.  So do we think yes or no?"
67,0,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T02:23:11.887Z,so i am going say if it was me i am an asshole in this case
67,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T02:23:14.373Z,We're supposed to agree.
67,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763358,lightBison,2020-04-28T02:23:25.357Z,it may seems like he has two wives having to answer to them both
67,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T02:23:26.541Z,"He is the asshole, if one has to be chosen"
67,1,5ea788e421028d2296a48cb8,curiousBear,2020-04-28T02:31:49.658Z,so now the wife's complaining on reddit? lol 
67,1,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:32:00.110Z,I am thinking that these factors are that spanish is her first language
67,1,5ea75dc4fd339b022f9ceb9c,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-28T02:32:00.295Z,"Yes, it's her side of the story."
67,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7633c1,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T02:32:03.358Z,so what do you guys think?
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:32:08.688Z,Yes.  It gives more perspective though.
67,1,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:32:14.025Z,I also think it is her Mother
67,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763358,brightGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:32:19.581Z,I dont think the husband should have to take every call and translate
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:32:20.849Z,"If she's going to school and he has free time, that's different."
67,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7633c1,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T02:32:27.015Z,agreed
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:32:27.032Z,"If her mom is older, that's different."
67,1,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:32:28.961Z,I then am considering that the husband is the head of the household
67,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763358,brightGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:32:29.345Z,i understand she is busy but it is her mom
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:32:30.030Z,So now I don't know.
67,1,5ea75dc4fd339b022f9ceb9c,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-28T02:32:31.223Z,"Again, I don't think she's an asshole, but definitely shouldn't expect her husband to answer every time her mom calls"
67,1,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:32:35.216Z,so she must be the aita
67,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T02:32:40.807Z,It sounds more like a chore for him than a request
67,1,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:32:50.660Z,I am just kidding I hate getting into other peoples fights even in a survey
67,1,5ea788e421028d2296a48cb8,curiousBear,2020-04-28T02:32:51.511Z,"If he has the free time, though "
67,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7633c1,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T02:32:51.650Z,they do say it's a lot harder to learn new languages the older you are
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:32:51.733Z,True. She needs to respect his view on it also.
67,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763358,brightGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:32:58.588Z,They both should translate it shouldn't fall totally on the husband
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:33:02.015Z,Seems like they should be able to come to some middle ground.
67,1,5ea19fe2de5d74641b66c67a,delightedMonkey,2020-04-28T02:33:04.174Z,SAME AS LAST ONE. NO ONE IS PURELY ALTRUISTIC AND ALSO NO ONE SHOULD EXPECT ANYONE TO DO ANYTYHING BUT WE DO SOMETIMES'. I DO. HAS SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT]
67,1,5ea788e421028d2296a48cb8,curiousBear,2020-04-28T02:33:06.886Z,and english is one of the hardest to learn 
67,1,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:33:07.653Z,they both should help their mother 
67,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763358,brightGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:33:19.514Z,i agree they both should help
67,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T02:33:27.102Z,I'm sure that he didn't mind at first but it would make sense that they collectively try to teach her English.
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:33:28.463Z,I agree brightGiraffe they should both help.
67,1,5ea788e421028d2296a48cb8,curiousBear,2020-04-28T02:33:29.424Z,"And take her culture into consideration, elders are to be respected and cared for, not made to do anything. "
67,1,5ea19fe2de5d74641b66c67a,delightedMonkey,2020-04-28T02:33:29.519Z,I AGREE ABOUT BOTH. SHE CAN TRANSLATE TOO
67,1,5ea75dc4fd339b022f9ceb9c,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-28T02:33:34.358Z,she should be more considerate of her husband and let her mom know to not take advantage of his help.
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:33:44.512Z,So then is is she the a?
67,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7633c1,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T02:33:52.948Z,"I am sure she does things in their marriage for her husband that she doesn't want to, so i can understand her wanting him to help"
67,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T02:33:54.157Z,Learning a new language can be fun too...it shouldn't be viewed as a bad thing
67,1,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:33:54.974Z,I say everyone is the A in this case
67,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763358,brightGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:34:00.434Z,she shouldnt assume that her husband married her and signed on to be the family translator
67,1,5ea75dc4fd339b022f9ceb9c,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-28T02:34:04.903Z,she also mentioned making fun of her husband being a 'gringo'...which definitely rubs me the wrong way.
67,1,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:34:08.236Z,well except for me of course
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:34:12.374Z,openOtter I agree but unfortunately that's not one of the chocies
67,1,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:34:13.737Z,ill be Z
67,1,5ea19fe2de5d74641b66c67a,delightedMonkey,2020-04-28T02:34:14.392Z,OPEN openOtter LOL AGREED
67,1,5ea19fe2de5d74641b66c67a,delightedMonkey,2020-04-28T02:34:23.977Z,I STILL SAY SHE IS THOUGH
67,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T02:34:40.633Z,I think that they equally are frustrated with the fact that translation is necessary and are blaming one another for it
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:34:48.501Z,inspiredGorilla
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:34:51.097Z,good point
67,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7633c1,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T02:34:52.404Z,wanting someone to do something and just expecting it are two different things too
67,1,5ea75dc4fd339b022f9ceb9c,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-28T02:34:52.419Z,agreed
67,1,5ea788e421028d2296a48cb8,curiousBear,2020-04-28T02:35:03.359Z,I don't think anyone's the asshole. gma and gpa just need a retirement home. Problem solved. 
67,1,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:35:12.289Z,Ya maybe if she hadnt opened with spanish is her first language implying she speaks it really well but doesnt want to be bothered so she dumps on some poor innnocent guy watching a football game
67,1,5ea75dc4fd339b022f9ceb9c,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-28T02:35:24.240Z,I can see both sides. I just think they have to come to a compromise.
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:35:25.480Z,She is really busy though.  
67,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T02:35:32.302Z,"I think that the ""expectation"" is what is weighing on the husband."
67,1,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:35:34.899Z,God bless em both they should kiss and make up
67,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763358,brightGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:35:35.720Z,too busy for conversation
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:35:37.076Z,They need to find a compromise and I wish I could work with them on that.
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:35:38.152Z,but
67,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7633c1,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T02:35:39.301Z,its frustrating having to deal with your spouses family sometimes but that is part of being married
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:35:42.977Z,we just have to decide
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:35:46.763Z,ista
67,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T02:35:50.759Z,Compromise is definitely needed in this scenario.
67,1,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:35:54.412Z,he should buy her flowers she should cook him corn bread and black beans light a candle and call it a night
67,1,5ea788e421028d2296a48cb8,curiousBear,2020-04-28T02:36:11.848Z,"I agree, they need compromise. Designated days to help mom. Designated days to teach mom a bit more english. etc. "
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:36:16.225Z,They should both sit down and help gma navigate.
67,1,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:36:16.409Z,and that what love is i guess people tell me so
67,1,5ea19fe2de5d74641b66c67a,delightedMonkey,2020-04-28T02:36:28.089Z,AGREED AGAIN OPEN openOtter BUT SHE IS STILL THE ASSHOLE
67,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763358,brightGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:36:28.497Z,communication
67,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7633c1,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T02:36:37.044Z,they should talk to each other instead of reddit
67,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T02:36:37.385Z,I'm sure gma feels like a third wheel as it is
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:36:48.025Z,"So sounds like we all agree, ish"
67,1,5ea788e421028d2296a48cb8,curiousBear,2020-04-28T02:36:50.477Z,I don't think she's the asshole either 
67,1,5ea75dc4fd339b022f9ceb9c,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-28T02:36:52.723Z,"I'd say she is the asshole, only because she's mad at him for not doing something she just put on him all together.  He didn't offer to do it."
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:36:55.481Z,I think gma may feel deeply loved.
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:37:00.779Z,Just confused.
67,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763358,brightGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:37:02.235Z,GMA gained a son and a personal translator
67,1,5ea19fe2de5d74641b66c67a,delightedMonkey,2020-04-28T02:37:06.326Z,SHE IS IN MY OPINION
67,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763eff,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T02:37:13.219Z,so yes?
67,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763358,brightGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:37:15.666Z,yes
67,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T02:37:24.041Z,"The whole situation is a teachable moment...sit down, as a family, and learn English/Spanish together"
67,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T02:37:29.150Z,yes
67,1,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:37:37.857Z,ty 8o))
67,1,5ea75dc4fd339b022f9ceb9c,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-28T02:37:38.058Z,i'm saying yes
67,1,5ea788e421028d2296a48cb8,curiousBear,2020-04-28T02:37:46.050Z,"I can't do a yes. I see frustration, but I don't see anyone acting like a legitimate asshole. "
67,1,5ea73b643ecdad5547203840,openOtter,2020-04-28T02:37:51.595Z,for the conversation
67,1,5ea19fe2de5d74641b66c67a,delightedMonkey,2020-04-28T02:37:58.514Z,I CANT GO AGAIDSNT WHAT I BELIEVE. AND HE HAS A ;LIFE AS WE;LL
67,1,5d482ea521c9be351f762645,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T02:38:31.207Z,She is the ahole.
68,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763891,lightBison,2020-04-28T02:07:45.531Z,It
68,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bfe,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T02:08:15.437Z,What did you guys end up going with? I think they are somewhat justified in their decision as they feel left out and just want to probably get to know their son's partner better. 
68,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634eb,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-28T02:08:26.040Z,I don't think the author made an unreasonable request. 
68,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763891,lightBison,2020-04-28T02:08:32.411Z,It's just rude to speak a foreign language in the presence of nonspeakers when you know the local language.
68,0,5ea736e63ecdad5547202f44,curiousHorse,2020-04-28T02:08:37.002Z,"My initial impression is that since the dad does not speak French and his son and partner know this, they should speak English to be polite. It would be nice to include him in the conversation."
68,0,5ea720023ecdad55471ff9bc,brightGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:08:38.217Z,well i believe that the son and his partner maybe should of spoke english instead of french. The reason why is because i feel like that does make someone one feel uncomfortable. 
68,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bfe,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T02:09:23.535Z,"I agree. They were all in the same room so I think as long as the dad asked nicely, it was a reasonable request."
68,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634eb,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-28T02:09:26.251Z,Sounds like most of us are in agreement.
68,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763891,lightBison,2020-04-28T02:09:28.315Z,Can we agree that it was a reasonable request to speak English?
68,0,5ea736e63ecdad5547202f44,curiousHorse,2020-04-28T02:09:38.750Z,"Yes, agreed."
68,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634eb,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-28T02:09:42.051Z,Yep.
68,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c80,openMonkey,2020-04-28T02:09:45.266Z,yes 
68,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bfe,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T02:09:47.975Z,Yeah.
68,0,5ea720023ecdad55471ff9bc,brightGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:09:49.135Z,it’s not polite to speak another language in front of other people that don’t speak their language 
68,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763891,lightBison,2020-04-28T02:09:49.851Z,Yay!
68,0,5ea720023ecdad55471ff9bc,brightGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:09:57.904Z,yes
68,0,5ea6fbae002f966295b200da,delightedOtter,2020-04-28T02:10:01.393Z,agree 
68,0,5ea720023ecdad55471ff9bc,brightGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:10:10.306Z,i am agree with you all lol
68,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c80,openMonkey,2020-04-28T02:10:18.086Z,But sometimes the way you convey the message also matters
68,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bfe,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T02:10:37.858Z,"Yeah, as long as he said it in a respectable way and not really harsh."
68,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763891,lightBison,2020-04-28T02:10:38.602Z,From an lightBison to a brightGiraffe thanks!
68,0,5ea6fbae002f966295b200da,delightedOtter,2020-04-28T02:11:07.104Z,"She might have handled it better by speaking privately with her son, but I don't think she was an ahole for asking."
68,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c80,openMonkey,2020-04-28T02:11:19.268Z,Finally concluded that the person is not an asshole
68,0,5ea720023ecdad55471ff9bc,brightGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:11:23.801Z,Maybe the son and the partner was talking about something that they didn’t want and the parent to know. 
68,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634eb,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-28T02:11:54.731Z,"Yeah, I think you'd have to have been there to know exactly how it was stated to make a true judgement, but from what information we have available it sounds like they're not the asshole."
68,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bfe,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T02:11:55.042Z,"I would think that'd be okay for the most part, but since they were all hanging out in the same room together, it would off a little rude"
68,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763891,lightBison,2020-04-28T02:12:08.011Z,I think that it was a perfectly reasonable request from people who speak multiple languages to accommodate the parties who are not bilingual. 
68,0,5ea720023ecdad55471ff9bc,brightGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:12:43.419Z,but than again they should of told the parent excuse me i am about to speak in french to my partner and i don’t want you to feel uncomfortable but it’s personal 
68,0,5ea720023ecdad55471ff9bc,brightGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:13:20.206Z,I don’t think the son and his partner is an asshole but that’s very rude 
68,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c80,openMonkey,2020-04-28T02:13:39.923Z,The person is not an asshole since his request is reasonable
68,0,5ea6fbae002f966295b200da,delightedOtter,2020-04-28T02:13:42.174Z,"While the mother might have handled this better and perhaps overrates her son's partners' English ability, any shortcoming on her part does not rise to the level of being an asshole"
68,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763891,inquisitiveHorse,2020-04-28T02:22:51.040Z,"Most Germans learn English from an early age, so it should not be a big leap to speak it in from of American in-laws."
68,1,5ea736e63ecdad5547202f44,brightElephant,2020-04-28T02:23:07.717Z,I'm considering the fact that the husband specifically said he feels uncomfortable speaking English.
68,1,5ea720023ecdad55471ff9bc,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:23:08.490Z,i think that the son is an asshole because his mom invited him and his partner to her home it’s only right to speak english in front of his mkm
68,1,5ea720023ecdad55471ff9bc,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:23:11.780Z,mom
68,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7634eb,fulfilledOtter,2020-04-28T02:23:13.854Z,I think that not speaking the language your host understands while spending a weekend with them is wrong.
68,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7634eb,fulfilledOtter,2020-04-28T02:23:26.862Z,Son is an asshole.
68,1,5ea720023ecdad55471ff9bc,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:23:39.458Z,yes so true 
68,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c80,novelCamel,2020-04-28T02:23:47.807Z,Inviting the person to a conversation is their own choise
68,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bfe,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:23:49.200Z,"I do kinda agree because while his partner can understand English, his mom can't understand German."
68,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763891,inquisitiveHorse,2020-04-28T02:23:56.161Z,"It is so wrong, when he knows English. Uncomfortable is pretty much the rule with inlaws."
68,1,5ea736e63ecdad5547202f44,brightElephant,2020-04-28T02:23:58.325Z,"On the other hand, I don't think it is unreasonable to make an effort to speak a language that you are familiar with."
68,1,5ea736e63ecdad5547202f44,brightElephant,2020-04-28T02:24:33.805Z,It's not like its a completely unfamiliar language to him.
68,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763891,inquisitiveHorse,2020-04-28T02:24:35.120Z,Mom is always right.
68,1,5ea720023ecdad55471ff9bc,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:24:39.209Z,yes but the partner understand a little just can’t speak too much english 
68,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bfe,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:24:44.731Z,He did say he spent a good majority of the time speaking German and not so much his family.
68,1,5ea720023ecdad55471ff9bc,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:25:00.683Z,yes that’s true he did that 
68,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7634eb,fulfilledOtter,2020-04-28T02:25:02.324Z,The son's husband's comfort comes second to the mother being able to catch up with her son over the weekend by talking to him. I don't think she invited them to spend the weekend so that she could just exist in the same room as them.
68,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bfe,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:25:09.585Z,The son should be there to be able to help his partner out if he runs into any English problems
68,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763891,inquisitiveHorse,2020-04-28T02:25:19.441Z,Are we in agreement? I'm with mom.
68,1,5ea6fbae002f966295b200da,eagerHippo,2020-04-28T02:25:26.825Z,"It's commendable that the daughter does not want to make her German husband uncomfortable.  Still, it's the mother's house and the son in law should be able to suck it up for a visit "
68,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7634eb,fulfilledOtter,2020-04-28T02:25:32.379Z,Same. Son's the asshole.
68,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bfe,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:25:41.241Z,I agree.
68,1,5ea736e63ecdad5547202f44,brightElephant,2020-04-28T02:25:43.175Z,Agreed
68,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c80,novelCamel,2020-04-28T02:26:02.177Z,I dont think son is an asshole
68,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7634eb,fulfilledOtter,2020-04-28T02:26:22.671Z,Why?
68,1,5ea720023ecdad55471ff9bc,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:26:35.340Z,yes i understand his partner doesn’t understand that much english but he should teach more and also speak english around his mother as well so she won’t feel uncomfortable 
68,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c80,novelCamel,2020-04-28T02:26:41.979Z,He didnt speak German before her mom
68,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763891,inquisitiveHorse,2020-04-28T02:26:52.769Z,"I can see both sides, but the fact that the partner can speak English (albeit awkwardly) makes it evident that he should speak English in the presence of mom. It's just good manners."
68,1,5ea6fbae002f966295b200da,eagerHippo,2020-04-28T02:27:05.982Z,good point
68,1,5ea736e63ecdad5547202f44,brightElephant,2020-04-28T02:27:07.217Z,He said for most of the weekend he spoke German. Why not speak English for at least half of that time? The partner understands it.
68,1,5ea720023ecdad55471ff9bc,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:27:10.642Z,yes he didn’t speak german before his mother 
68,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bfe,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:27:12.709Z,Exactly
68,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bfe,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:27:24.418Z,He said he spent of his time speaking German that weekend he spent at his mother's house
68,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763891,inquisitiveHorse,2020-04-28T02:27:31.662Z,50-50 sounds about right!
68,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7634eb,fulfilledOtter,2020-04-28T02:27:44.436Z,They said that he WAS speaking German.
68,1,5ea720023ecdad55471ff9bc,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:27:50.144Z,yes this person is an asshole 
68,1,5ea6fbae002f966295b200da,eagerHippo,2020-04-28T02:27:53.390Z,I would still vote asshole
68,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c80,novelCamel,2020-04-28T02:28:06.090Z,I stick on to he is not an asshole
68,1,5ea720023ecdad55471ff9bc,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:28:11.731Z,i would vote asshole too lol
68,1,5ea736e63ecdad5547202f44,brightElephant,2020-04-28T02:28:29.254Z,"Yes, I vote asshole. He could've come up with a better arrangement (like speaking half English half German)"
68,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763bfe,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:28:38.481Z,The mom was upset though that she didn't get to speak to him much while he was staying at her house
69,0,5ea6fc76002f966295b2010a,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T01:47:25.223Z,"Here, the mother was not the asshole"
69,0,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,openOtter,2020-04-28T01:47:35.927Z,Definitely
69,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625ef,eagerZebra,2020-04-28T01:47:38.663Z,I don't think she was either
69,0,5ea75d88fd339b022f9ceb96,curiousMonkey,2020-04-28T01:47:39.351Z,I feel like the women should have told her son her concerns by himself and let him tell his partner later on so his partner would take it better from him
69,0,5ea6fc76002f966295b2010a,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T01:47:53.533Z,She felt distressful about their language spoken
69,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,fulfilledElephant,2020-04-28T01:48:04.777Z,I believe the mother was the asshole. I thinki she could have told her son in private about her concerns before embarrassing the partner
69,0,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,openOtter,2020-04-28T01:48:16.936Z,She claims that she was being excluded because they were talking in another language. But you're not included in all conversations where you do understand the language being spoken!
69,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625ef,eagerZebra,2020-04-28T01:48:18.896Z,The son's should not have spoke a different language if they were invited into the mothers home
69,0,5ea75d88fd339b022f9ceb96,curiousMonkey,2020-04-28T01:48:21.444Z,I dont think she was a A hole completly i think she could have handled it better 
69,0,5ea73a743ecdad554720364b,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-28T01:48:28.450Z,I agree with fulfilledElephant she should've brought it up privately before making it a public issue
69,0,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,openOtter,2020-04-28T01:48:32.584Z,"A married couple should be able to have a conversation by themselves, whatever the language."
69,0,5ea6fc76002f966295b2010a,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T01:48:47.243Z,From the mother side we could tell that she also has equal rights
69,0,5ea6fc76002f966295b2010a,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T01:48:57.298Z,so mother couldn't be an asshole
69,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,fulfilledElephant,2020-04-28T01:49:00.760Z,I think she could have handled it better. The partner just might not feel comfortable speaking english as they do french and defaulted to that language
69,0,5ea63b2e7c882f6974ff3205,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-28T01:49:15.578Z,"I feel like this person is the ""asshole"" in this situation, they know that the partner does not speak much English. She made the encounter about themselves when really she could have talked with her son about her concerns. "
69,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,fulfilledElephant,2020-04-28T01:49:16.822Z,She didn't need to call them out like that.
69,0,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,openOtter,2020-04-28T01:49:18.376Z,Do you have the right to insert yourself in every conversation happening in her home
69,0,5ea6fc76002f966295b2010a,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T01:49:31.059Z,"There they mention the partner was an accent, and can speak English"
69,0,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,openOtter,2020-04-28T01:49:40.596Z,I feel like the language is a red herring
69,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625ef,eagerZebra,2020-04-28T01:49:41.280Z,"For the guys side, it is their normal language to speak at home"
69,0,5ea73a743ecdad554720364b,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-28T01:49:42.951Z,"I think the fact that she brought it up in front of everyone makes her an asshole in and of itself. That, and just because the two are speaking in a different language doesn't mean she has the right to butt in and change that"
69,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,fulfilledElephant,2020-04-28T01:49:50.486Z,That doesn't mean the partner is 100% comfortable with english
69,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,fulfilledElephant,2020-04-28T01:50:09.525Z,from the mothers perspective she may have felt that was good enough to speak it always
69,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,fulfilledElephant,2020-04-28T01:50:15.221Z,but this may not be the case
69,0,5ea63b2e7c882f6974ff3205,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-28T01:50:21.579Z,She could have taken some initiative to break the ice and ask about some french words then explain how she can't understand. The way she brought up her feelings was childish. 
69,0,5ea6fc76002f966295b2010a,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T01:50:21.709Z,"If it was their personal talk, they could have it personally"
69,0,5ea6fc76002f966295b2010a,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T01:50:30.911Z,not in front of his mother
69,0,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,openOtter,2020-04-28T01:50:32.229Z,She didn't want them to be able to speak in a private conversation. She is nosey and controlling.
69,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625ef,eagerZebra,2020-04-28T01:50:36.209Z,"from the guys perspective, maybe the partner is just shy at speaking english"
69,0,5ea75d88fd339b022f9ceb96,curiousMonkey,2020-04-28T01:50:44.895Z,ANd she did say she told them nicely but she still shoulda pulled him aside in private. 
69,0,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,openOtter,2020-04-28T01:50:46.622Z,Have you never spoken to one person while others are around?
69,0,5ea73a743ecdad554720364b,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-28T01:50:51.518Z,"I can see her side that she feels disrespected possible in her own home, but the thing is, they weren't even necessarily talking to her. They both spoke a different language so it's really no biggy"
69,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,fulfilledElephant,2020-04-28T01:51:17.604Z,So I think most of us are in agreement that it could have been handled better
69,0,5ea73a743ecdad554720364b,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-28T01:51:27.124Z,I agree
69,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625ef,eagerZebra,2020-04-28T01:51:31.529Z,I agree with inspiredGiraffe she's not an asshole but may have just overthought it
69,0,5ea75d88fd339b022f9ceb96,curiousMonkey,2020-04-28T01:51:35.796Z,I dont think she was intentionally trying to be a jerk but she did come across that way. 
69,0,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,openOtter,2020-04-28T01:51:41.909Z,"If you were to take out the language part, what would you say if instead the mother was complaining that they weren't speaking loud enough for her to hear?"
69,0,5ea6fc76002f966295b2010a,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T01:51:46.989Z,She is not asshole
69,0,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,openOtter,2020-04-28T01:51:51.378Z,Her complaint is that she couldn't hear and participate in their conversation
69,0,5ea73a743ecdad554720364b,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-28T01:51:57.249Z,"I don't think she's an asshole as a person, but in this excerpt specifically, she was a bit of an ass. so I'd vote yes to her being an asshole"
69,0,5ea6fc76002f966295b2010a,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T01:51:59.419Z,majority was not an asshole
69,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,fulfilledElephant,2020-04-28T01:52:03.099Z,"So I think if anyone is an asshole its the mother but only a little, because it could have been handled better and without embarrassment"
69,0,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,openOtter,2020-04-28T01:52:11.788Z,"If they weren't talking loud enough to each other for her to hear and join in, then were they being an asshole?"
69,0,5ea75d88fd339b022f9ceb96,curiousMonkey,2020-04-28T01:52:13.221Z,okay vote
69,0,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,openOtter,2020-04-28T01:52:18.028Z,Yes
69,0,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,openOtter,2020-04-28T01:52:21.069Z,The mother is the asshone
69,0,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,openOtter,2020-04-28T01:52:28.879Z,*The mother is the asshole
69,0,5ea75d88fd339b022f9ceb96,curiousMonkey,2020-04-28T01:52:30.011Z,asshole by majority 
69,0,5ea75d88fd339b022f9ceb96,curiousMonkey,2020-04-28T01:52:41.546Z,i didnt think she was but its majority 
69,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7625ef,eagerZebra,2020-04-28T01:53:02.451Z,i dont think so but its majority
69,0,5ea6fc76002f966295b2010a,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T01:53:08.243Z,"The mother was not an asshole, as she has her rights to ask her son about the language they spoke that was distressful to her"
69,0,5ea75d88fd339b022f9ceb96,curiousMonkey,2020-04-28T01:53:16.722Z,hurry and vote 
69,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:02:05.265Z,So...I'm thinking the daughter might be the asshole here but just barely. I can see both sides of this.
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:02:16.980Z,My initial impression is that this poster is caught in the middle. She isn't trying to disrespect her mom but she kind of it.
69,1,5ea75d88fd339b022f9ceb96,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T02:02:24.628Z,I don’t think this person is an a hole because his reasonings weren’t for selfish intentions he wasn’t purposely trying to keep the mother out of the conversation. 
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:02:29.267Z,Only because she should be also spending quality one on one time with her mom
69,1,5ea6fc76002f966295b2010a,novelGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:02:33.791Z,She might not be an asshole
69,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7625ef,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:02:43.100Z,I dont think he is an asshole
69,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:02:50.290Z,I think it would have been a better choice to speak German when the mother isn't around
69,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:03:06.983Z,Like if they're by themselves they can speak it but in front of the mother try for English
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:03:07.735Z,The daughter can do a better job of making the mother feel more kept up to date with her life
69,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7625ef,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:03:08.858Z,But I do think they should be more considerate considering they are at his moms
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:03:15.276Z,Speak to the mother separately in English!
69,1,5ea6fc76002f966295b2010a,novelGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:03:18.978Z,The person in the paragraph clearly said that the partner was not comfortable in speaking English
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:03:26.884Z,The husband should definitely also be trying a little bit to speak in English to the mother-in-law.
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:03:35.407Z,"Even just a few words, I'm sure it would mean a lot to her"
69,1,5ea73a743ecdad554720364b,eagerBison,2020-04-28T02:03:40.644Z,"I think the OP is an asshole, honestly. They could play both sides and agree to talk to their mother in English more, but they're being super all-or-nothing and only going with their SO."
69,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7625ef,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:03:46.377Z,"Or at least they could explain it to the mother, she should know"
69,1,5ea75d88fd339b022f9ceb96,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T02:03:50.007Z, he wHe was just trying to make his husband comfortable but he should have expressed his husbands situation to her so she would understand why they were speaking german
69,1,5ea6fc76002f966295b2010a,novelGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:03:50.610Z,As the person has their own rights to speak their own language
69,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:03:53.887Z,I mean if hes not comfortable speaking English maybe he can still understand it and the daughter could just translate
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:03:57.251Z,Huh. I didn't think she was an asshole but I agree that it shouldn't be all or nothing
69,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7625ef,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:04:04.981Z,I like liv
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:04:07.643Z,And that's another good point that the daughter can translate
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:04:24.764Z,"You guys are kind of pulling me to the ""She's an asshole"" side"
69,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:04:27.952Z,I think the daughter is the asshole. She could have taken a more nuanced approach and instead chose the extreme
69,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7625ef,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:04:29.984Z,"I like that point, it would include all of them in the conversation"
69,1,5ea73a743ecdad554720364b,eagerBison,2020-04-28T02:04:43.225Z,"Like there's no communication here. The OP is going all the way in with their SO but his/her parents love them and they can 1) translate for both sides and 2) talk to the parents in English, it's not hard. It's just talking."
69,1,5ea75d88fd339b022f9ceb96,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T02:04:55.675Z,Yeah its true they could have translated good point
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:04:59.076Z,The daughter should translate
69,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7625ef,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:05:15.821Z,eagerBison has a point they should have put in the effort more if staying with the parents
69,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:05:33.589Z,Like if she cared about her mom being happy too she could have found a compromise
69,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7625ef,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:05:41.748Z,From the mom's side she just wants to hear how they are doing
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:05:45.864Z,Are you guys thinking that she's an asshole now?
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:05:49.818Z,I kind of am.
69,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:05:51.662Z,I think she is
69,1,5ea75d88fd339b022f9ceb96,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T02:05:56.004Z,Yeah she kinda did just decide to choose the husband over the moms feelings
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:05:59.780Z,Anyone else? What are you thinking?
69,1,5ea73a743ecdad554720364b,eagerBison,2020-04-28T02:06:01.162Z,Yes I think OP is being a bit of an ass
69,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7625ef,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:06:11.190Z,Eh I think she is but not a super big asshole
69,1,5ea6fc76002f966295b2010a,novelGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:06:12.142Z,"The persona was an asshole, as a human, they have their own rights to do whatever they want and can do according to the situation"
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:06:15.697Z,What do you guys think about this situation compared to the previous one?
69,1,5ea75d88fd339b022f9ceb96,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T02:06:27.044Z,i think the last situation was worse
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:06:27.814Z,"Because we thought that they weren't the asshole, yet here are mostly thinking that she is"
69,1,5ea6fc76002f966295b2010a,novelGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:06:29.431Z,Not an asshole
69,1,5ea73a743ecdad554720364b,eagerBison,2020-04-28T02:06:30.257Z,"Sure, as a human you can do what you want. But you're still an asshole for doing certain things"
69,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:06:34.083Z,I think they're similar but we can only work with the info we're given by the narrator
69,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7625ef,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:06:39.754Z,pretty much the same I think
69,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:07:23.563Z,"I think the daughter could have found a better compromise, she's the asshole here"
69,1,5ea75d88fd339b022f9ceb96,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T02:07:38.402Z,but u guys said they were an a hole for confronting the differnt language and now ur saying they are an asshole for speaking the language 
69,1,5ea6fc76002f966295b2010a,novelGiraffe,2020-04-28T02:07:43.572Z,"The persona was an asshole, as a human, they have their own rights to do whatever they want and can do according to the situation"
69,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7625ef,curiousOtter,2020-04-28T02:07:44.601Z,"Conclusion, I think she is an asshole, they could have communicated better between all of them"
69,1,5ea75d88fd339b022f9ceb96,excitedHippo,2020-04-28T02:08:01.209Z,okay so yes to asshole then
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:08:06.310Z,"The daughter is an asshole, not in the general sense of the word, but if we have to assign blame I think it's her. She didn't try very hard and is acting helpless when there were other options she could take to remedy the situation."
69,1,5ea63e087c882f6974ff3233,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T02:08:13.160Z,All in favor of asshole? Say ay!
69,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:08:17.644Z,I felt the mom was an asshole i nthe last one because she could have brought it up better.
69,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764173,livelyGorilla,2020-04-28T02:08:26.164Z,Not because she wanted to be included
69,1,5ea73a743ecdad554720364b,eagerBison,2020-04-28T02:08:29.583Z,That's the experiment I suppose
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763134,inspiredHorse,2020-04-28T20:15:02.351Z,"I don't think the man is an asshole, and he's definitely in a tough situation."
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bd,lightCamel,2020-04-28T20:15:10.194Z,I am thinking the author is not the asshole.  If he has a job & the mother is calling him while he is working to get translation assistance his job could be at risk.
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763134,inspiredHorse,2020-04-28T20:15:27.518Z,He has created the expectation that he'll be available whenever his MIL needs him.
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763398,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:15:43.586Z,"I think the same, he is not an a-hole. It can be tough to be the designated translator."
70,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762df0,curiousZebra,2020-04-28T20:15:50.609Z,"But Old people needs more time learn things. They have many difficulties with their health , feelings too"
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bd,lightCamel,2020-04-28T20:15:59.274Z,I also considered that she has been here 8 years.  I don't think I could go 8 years where I would need someone to translate for me all of the time.  I would not like to be that dependent upon others.
70,0,5ea888a27d50722703c540f0,openGorilla,2020-04-28T20:16:06.192Z,It's also different when you're coming from one country to another
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763134,inspiredHorse,2020-04-28T20:16:06.222Z,"He has every right to change that expectation, but he can't dictate what his MIL does."
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763398,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:16:22.013Z,"It depends on how old she actually is. And still, an effort should be made."
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bd,lightCamel,2020-04-28T20:16:48.136Z,Yes - I agree she needs to make an effort.
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763134,inspiredHorse,2020-04-28T20:17:12.975Z,"He can only control what he does, like not dropping whatever he's doing to accommodate his MIL. Eventually, she'll catch on."
70,0,5ea888a27d50722703c540f0,openGorilla,2020-04-28T20:17:13.035Z,"Yeah, I do agree that an effort should be made. Age would play a huge factor in this "
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763398,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:17:25.536Z,"I'm sure he was trying to be helpful in the beginning, but he became a crutch."
70,0,5ea888a27d50722703c540f0,openGorilla,2020-04-28T20:17:44.858Z,She did start to depend on him too much 
70,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762df0,curiousZebra,2020-04-28T20:18:00.765Z,Man should handle this in a polite way
70,0,5ea87ce07d50722703c533b8,novelElephant,2020-04-28T20:18:09.981Z,I think it's reasonable to expect her to have started at least taking classes or following guides to learn spanish herself. He can help but shouldn't have to a full-on translator all the time.
70,0,5ea888a27d50722703c540f0,openGorilla,2020-04-28T20:18:20.442Z,I definitely agree with that. He sounded very hostile 
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763398,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:18:20.702Z,"It's hard when the whole family is against you and you've not done anything wrong, really."
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763134,inspiredHorse,2020-04-28T20:18:23.426Z,"The MIL likely doesn't feel the need to learn English, since everyone in her family and neighborhood speaks Spanish."
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bd,lightCamel,2020-04-28T20:18:43.704Z,It is sad that the whole family has turned against him.  
70,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762df0,curiousZebra,2020-04-28T20:18:51.985Z,she can learn english by watching English cartoons
70,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762df0,curiousZebra,2020-04-28T20:19:07.355Z,or they can use translator tool
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bd,lightCamel,2020-04-28T20:19:13.517Z,I can only imagine the cringe he feels when he sees her number on the phone because he knows she is looking for him to translate.
70,0,5ea87ce07d50722703c533b8,novelElephant,2020-04-28T20:19:17.418Z,"Yeah, start with baby steps to learn. Some effort at least."
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763134,inspiredHorse,2020-04-28T20:19:20.133Z,"Maybe it would have been received better if he spoke to his daughter, and asked her to speak with her mother."
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763398,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:19:40.519Z,"I think his hostility was his frustration, and he did clarify that he was polite with the MIL"
70,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762df0,curiousZebra,2020-04-28T20:19:53.591Z,Yes This person is a asshole
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763398,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:20:02.369Z,"No, not an asshole"
70,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762df0,curiousZebra,2020-04-28T20:20:11.737Z,Its insult she never forget till death
70,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763134,inspiredHorse,2020-04-28T20:20:25.584Z,"As I said earlier, I don't think he is an asshole."
70,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762df0,curiousZebra,2020-04-28T20:20:39.611Z,yes
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bd,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:44:15.903Z,My initial impression is that the the author is the asshole.
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763134,livelyMonkey,2020-04-28T20:44:33.554Z,"The woman summarized her post by asking, ""AITA for making my husband translate stuff for my mom?"" I think she answered her own question."
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763398,lightGorilla,2020-04-28T20:44:55.373Z,"While technically she is the a-hole in the situation, I think it's more about expectations and assumptions."
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763134,livelyMonkey,2020-04-28T20:45:09.097Z,"She is not an asshole for wanting her husband's help, but is she for assuming he's willing to keep giving it."
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bd,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:45:09.729Z,"I base this on her expecting her husband to be available whenever her mother needs a translation.  Also, for her being mad that he suggested her parents learn English."
70,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762df0,inspiredDolphin,2020-04-28T20:45:20.624Z,"The woman should know their limits , she is distrubing lot"
70,2,5ea888a27d50722703c540f0,novelOtter,2020-04-28T20:45:31.131Z,She did mention that he does have more free time than her 
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763134,livelyMonkey,2020-04-28T20:45:51.842Z,Her family is NOT his family; she has more responsibility to them than he does.
70,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762df0,inspiredDolphin,2020-04-28T20:46:02.549Z,"She should use the technology to translate, google translate"
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763398,lightGorilla,2020-04-28T20:46:15.382Z,The expectation that just because he married into the family automatically makes him responsible is alot to put on someone
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bd,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:46:35.713Z,"I agree livelyMonkey - they are the authors family, not her husband's.  Even though you gain your spouse's family there still has to be some boundaries."
70,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762df0,inspiredDolphin,2020-04-28T20:47:02.581Z,We should live independently. This happens to everyone when we depend things on other person.
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bd,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:47:23.537Z,And is the author assuming her husband has more free time because she is working on a degree?  What responsibilities does he have?  Is mother-in-law calling him when he is otherwise occupied expecting a translation?
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763134,livelyMonkey,2020-04-28T20:47:31.956Z,"Definitely, eagerGiraffe. If she sounded more appreciative than expectant, her husband might not be as bothered."
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763398,lightGorilla,2020-04-28T20:47:51.029Z,"While it's hard not to feel comfortable in the language, efforts should be made. Then people are more willing to help if efforts are made"
70,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762df0,inspiredDolphin,2020-04-28T20:48:31.398Z,Using the technology solves this problem.
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763398,lightGorilla,2020-04-28T20:48:31.748Z,Very good points
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763134,livelyMonkey,2020-04-28T20:48:39.933Z,"In summary, I think she's the asshole in this scenario."
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bd,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:48:59.049Z,Yes -technology has provide a lot of new options in translation than were available even 10 years ago.
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763398,lightGorilla,2020-04-28T20:49:03.543Z,Technology is good but only if you know how to use it
70,2,5ea888a27d50722703c540f0,novelOtter,2020-04-28T20:49:21.490Z,"Yeah I agree, we don't know how old she is either, so maybe she doesn't know how to use it. "
70,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762df0,inspiredDolphin,2020-04-28T20:49:25.444Z,Even siri and ok google do that
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763398,lightGorilla,2020-04-28T20:50:04.604Z,"Yes, she is the a-hole due to expectations placed on the hubby"
70,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bd,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:50:05.924Z,In conclusion I think the author is an asshole for expecting her husband to be available at anytime to translate for her mother.
70,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762df0,inspiredDolphin,2020-04-28T20:50:08.326Z,Woman should not depend not anyone. she should start using the technology
70,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762df0,inspiredDolphin,2020-04-28T20:50:37.775Z,she is not an asshole
71,0,5ea8823a7d50722703c539e8,lightHippo,2020-04-28T19:59:53.731Z,"So, what did you all think?"
71,0,5ea869c67d50722703c4fd3d,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T20:00:09.733Z,my initial impression is that this person's an asshole. or at least being a bit unreasonable
71,0,5ea8823a7d50722703c539e8,lightHippo,2020-04-28T20:00:13.467Z,I don't really know how to side on this one.
71,0,5ea877b87d50722703c52da7,curiousZebra,2020-04-28T20:00:25.833Z,I think she's right it is rude toexclude someone
71,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76280f,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-28T20:00:29.004Z,"Yes, I thought they were being very unreasonable"

71,0,5ea873447d50722703c5242f,delightedBison,2020-04-28T20:00:44.053Z,"She could have been much more reasonable, and sat down to engage in a conversation."
71,0,5ea869c67d50722703c4fd3d,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T20:00:44.462Z,"he might speak english, but it might make him uncomfortable, or he may not be very good at it"

71,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca2,inspiredCamel,2020-04-28T20:01:03.161Z,I am thinking that the person is an asshole. The other party does not know much English so she probably made him uncomfortable.
71,0,5ea877b87d50722703c52da7,curiousZebra,2020-04-28T20:01:11.645Z,"I've been in this situation myself, you feel like wallpaper"
71,0,5ea869c67d50722703c4fd3d,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T20:01:26.373Z,"where you were the french person, so to speak?"
71,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76280f,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-28T20:01:26.668Z,I took it that it was just some conversation between the couple and it was easier to be spoken in french
71,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca2,inspiredCamel,2020-04-28T20:01:55.648Z,I am sure that the other person feels the same way when they are speaking in English. 
71,0,5ea877b87d50722703c52da7,curiousZebra,2020-04-28T20:01:57.828Z,no i was the american
71,0,5ea8823a7d50722703c539e8,lightHippo,2020-04-28T20:02:09.937Z,"I thought she had a point since they were all together but they chose to speak a language she can't understand. However, like livelyDolphin said, he may have been self-conscious about his English "
71,0,5ea873447d50722703c5242f,delightedBison,2020-04-28T20:02:12.576Z,Insecure people tend to think that people are talking about them when they can't understand what is being said.

71,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76280f,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-28T20:02:51.745Z,No information on whether her son offered to translate or anything. Too little information given. They just seemed offended.
71,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca2,inspiredCamel,2020-04-28T20:03:15.078Z,She should have asked what they were talking about before calling them out or being rude about it.

71,0,5ea8823a7d50722703c539e8,lightHippo,2020-04-28T20:03:40.758Z,I think that's a fair point. The first thing she did was default to accusations.
71,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76280f,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-28T20:03:41.405Z,I think both sides could be more understanding.
71,0,5ea873447d50722703c5242f,delightedBison,2020-04-28T20:03:42.249Z,She could ask her son to translate
71,0,5ea869c67d50722703c4fd3d,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T20:03:59.369Z,agreed
71,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76280f,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-28T20:04:00.052Z,I think that's a fair request.

71,0,5ea869c67d50722703c4fd3d,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T20:04:12.346Z,she could have definitely approached it differently
71,0,5ea873447d50722703c5242f,delightedBison,2020-04-28T20:04:16.739Z,Asshole

71,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76280f,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-28T20:04:21.918Z,Agree. Asshole.
71,0,5ea869c67d50722703c4fd3d,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T20:04:24.775Z,asshole
71,0,5ea877b87d50722703c52da7,curiousZebra,2020-04-28T20:04:38.528Z,It says in the writeup that the son's partner can speak English just with an accent. There is no reason for the two men to exclude her
71,0,5ea877b87d50722703c52da7,curiousZebra,2020-04-28T20:04:48.883Z,"I disagree, not an asshole"

71,0,5ea883c07d50722703c53b68,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-28T20:04:56.120Z,It is stated he knows english and he won't speak it because he doesnt want to
71,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7638ea,brightBear,2020-04-28T20:04:58.969Z,not an asshole to me
71,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7636c4,excitedOtter,2020-04-28T20:05:08.833Z,Yes she could have asked someone to tell her a paraphrase of what was being said when people paused the conversation then that gives a cue to someone to volunteer to make sure she stays in the conversation
71,0,5ea8823a7d50722703c539e8,lightHippo,2020-04-28T20:05:17.013Z,What if they were talking about something like what they do in the bedroom or a private medical condition?
71,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7636c4,excitedOtter,2020-04-28T20:05:20.287Z,yes she is the asshole
71,0,5ea869c67d50722703c4fd3d,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T20:05:38.523Z,it said they were doing it all week
71,0,5ea869c67d50722703c4fd3d,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T20:05:44.373Z,and the french guy rarely ever spoke english
71,0,5ea869c67d50722703c4fd3d,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T20:05:44.947Z,so
71,0,5ea869c67d50722703c4fd3d,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T20:05:51.058Z,it's probably not that
71,0,5ea883c07d50722703c53b68,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-28T20:05:53.976Z,if it's something private do it in the bedroom

71,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7638ea,brightBear,2020-04-28T20:06:02.061Z,They should have saved all private conversations for another time
71,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca2,inspiredCamel,2020-04-28T20:06:15.520Z,I still think she is an asshole for being rude about it. 
71,0,5d482ea621c9be351f76280f,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-28T20:06:23.177Z,It said they were staying for a week

71,3,5ea8823a7d50722703c539e8,livelyBison,2020-04-28T20:44:41.403Z,I thought OP was the asshole.
71,3,5ea8823a7d50722703c539e8,livelyBison,2020-04-28T20:44:45.030Z,Thoughts?
71,3,5ea869c67d50722703c4fd3d,inspiredHippo,2020-04-28T20:44:51.299Z,same but also not same
71,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636c4,eagerMonkey,2020-04-28T20:44:51.673Z,Yes I agree 
71,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76280f,openCamel,2020-04-28T20:44:55.245Z,I feel she was a bit of an asshole here because she could've offered to translate for her mother.
71,3,5ea869c67d50722703c4fd3d,inspiredHippo,2020-04-28T20:45:11.828Z,I think he should have done more to try and encourage his SO to participate in english instead of german
71,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7638ea,novelDolphin,2020-04-28T20:45:26.879Z,I think the person in this story was the asshole.
71,3,5ea877b87d50722703c52da7,delightedHorse,2020-04-28T20:45:28.788Z,This one is not that clear cut to me. She's kind of an ahole but not completely
71,3,5ea8823a7d50722703c539e8,livelyBison,2020-04-28T20:45:35.947Z,"I understand the German partner was uncomfortable with English, but they could've put in a bit more effort into practicing."
71,3,5ea869c67d50722703c4fd3d,inspiredHippo,2020-04-28T20:45:43.717Z,yeah I think kind of an asshole is fair
71,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76280f,openCamel,2020-04-28T20:45:48.923Z,\She could've done things to make both her husband and her mother feel more at ease.
71,3,5ea873447d50722703c5242f,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T20:45:51.117Z,There is a middle ground between including mom and making husband comfortable. 
71,3,5ea883c07d50722703c53b68,fulfilledOtter,2020-04-28T20:45:57.082Z,"I also feel like she was the asshole. She was only staying there for one weekend, she could have afforded to make the husband uncomfortable for one weekend"
71,3,5ea869c67d50722703c4fd3d,inspiredHippo,2020-04-28T20:46:05.776Z,it's tough to definitively say anyone is a cut and dry asshole
71,3,5ea8823a7d50722703c539e8,livelyBison,2020-04-28T20:46:11.219Z,"Heck, even with broken English, I think the mother would've still been appreciative."
71,3,5ea869c67d50722703c4fd3d,inspiredHippo,2020-04-28T20:46:19.137Z,but we have to so I'm going with asshole
71,3,5ea8823a7d50722703c539e8,livelyBison,2020-04-28T20:46:31.259Z,Anyone with dissenting opinions?
71,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636c4,eagerMonkey,2020-04-28T20:46:38.758Z,"He could have explained to his partner that since it was a long time since seeing his mom, he might spend more time talking to her and that he shoud not take it personally they have a lot to talk about on the trip home"
71,3,5ea877b87d50722703c52da7,delightedHorse,2020-04-28T20:46:54.396Z,reluctantly she's an ahole

71,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca2,lightGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:47:04.723Z,This was way harder I almost feel like everyone is at fault. There was such a lack of explanation on all parties sides. 
71,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636c4,eagerMonkey,2020-04-28T20:47:10.992Z,at the same time he would tell his mom he would paraphrase their conversation in german so hs partner doesnt feel left out
71,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76280f,openCamel,2020-04-28T20:47:14.745Z,"Why not speak English to the mother, German to the husband and then just translate whatever the mother wanted to know? Instead she just let her mom not know what was going on. Seemed a little cold."
71,3,5ea883c07d50722703c53b68,fulfilledOtter,2020-04-28T20:47:30.254Z,Partner is the asshole
71,3,5ea8823a7d50722703c539e8,livelyBison,2020-04-28T20:47:37.317Z,Even if the partner just spoke German and OP translated to English would've been fine
71,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76280f,openCamel,2020-04-28T20:47:48.859Z,Exactly
71,3,5ea8823a7d50722703c539e8,livelyBison,2020-04-28T20:47:50.258Z,Since he supposedly understood English
71,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7638ea,novelDolphin,2020-04-28T20:47:57.065Z,They should have considered the mom in this situation
71,3,5ea8823a7d50722703c539e8,livelyBison,2020-04-28T20:48:04.152Z,OP wouldn't have had to translate back to him
71,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca2,lightGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:48:09.915Z,I agree with that. Someone could have translated to help every one feel as if they were involved. 
71,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636c4,eagerMonkey,2020-04-28T20:48:15.686Z,Too bad it doesnt say if the partner made any other effort that doesnt require speaking to show respect to the mom when they met like giving her flowers
71,3,5ea8823a7d50722703c539e8,livelyBison,2020-04-28T20:48:15.808Z,Unless there was a word or two he was unfamiliar with
71,3,5ea877b87d50722703c52da7,delightedHorse,2020-04-28T20:48:31.972Z,this line of thinking makes a lot of sense
71,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636c4,eagerMonkey,2020-04-28T20:48:34.950Z,Maybe that was why she felt left out in her own home
71,3,5ea8823a7d50722703c539e8,livelyBison,2020-04-28T20:48:47.569Z,"Heck, the translating to English might've made him more comfortable trying."
71,3,5ea883c07d50722703c53b68,fulfilledOtter,2020-04-28T20:48:50.546Z,Poor mom...
71,3,5ea873447d50722703c5242f,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T20:48:53.334Z,"The husband may be uncomfortable, but the mom is hosting him in her home. He could put forth some effort, even if it is uncomfortable. I am sure mom feels hurt and left out. "
71,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca2,lightGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:48:58.963Z,Even then maybe he could have asked for clarification. Its a catch 22 though because not everyone is going to be happy. 
71,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76280f,openCamel,2020-04-28T20:49:11.393Z,I think it's the least they could do since the mother was trying to make them feel at home
71,3,5ea8823a7d50722703c539e8,livelyBison,2020-04-28T20:49:16.669Z,Agreed

71,3,5ea873447d50722703c5242f,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-28T20:49:52.682Z,It is like they came to visit and refuse to speak to her. 
71,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca2,lightGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:49:55.067Z,I agree the OP was an asshole for not including her mom.

71,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762ca2,lightGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:50:28.980Z,Right that poor mom.

As long as the husband has a fair amount of free time and the wife is still helping with the calls every once in a while I don't see the issue.
72,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7634d3,brightHippo,2020-04-28T19:35:26.848Z,I think it would be frustrating as the husband to be translating a lot of material for the wife's family though. If they're calling every day I can see why he would want the wife to handle the calls and translating.

Although after hearing how her husbands opinion.  I think that the wife should take some of the responsibility since it is her parents. 
72,0,5ea7a4e621028d2296a4dba0,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T19:37:09.188Z,It might be annoying but if you marry someone it shouldn't be too big of a deal.

72,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7631fe,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-28T19:39:31.544Z,It may be the lady feeling degraded out of his own childhood experiences.

72,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7627d8,brightBison,2020-04-28T20:19:14.482Z,I think when he spoke to his mother in law he was polite.
72,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762d10,inquisitiveBear,2020-04-28T20:19:35.071Z,I didn't feel like this person was being an asshole. The mom been in the USA for over 8 years. Learning english would help her a lot. I would be frustrated just like the man.
72,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631fe,excitedGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:19:36.641Z,At first I thought he is the real asshole for coming off so rude to the mother in law by calling what she had been doing shit.
72,3,5ea7a4e621028d2296a4dba0,openGorilla,2020-04-28T20:19:45.977Z,"Honestly it's a little hard for me to decide because he has a point, but if it't only sometimes and she's old I don't think he should necessarily expect her to learn English."
72,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7634d3,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T20:19:54.845Z,I think it's reasonable that he is frustrated with his mother in law. She's calling him a lot for fairly simple questions. 
72,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7627d8,brightBison,2020-04-28T20:19:55.339Z,I think he got tired to being interrupted constantly.
72,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7627d8,brightBison,2020-04-28T20:20:16.848Z,I see his point of view.
72,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762d10,inquisitiveBear,2020-04-28T20:20:17.901Z,She would be wise to learn english for herself. 
72,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631fe,excitedGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:20:23.834Z,"Then with the help of the ""edit"", I realized that he spoke to the mother kindly. "
72,3,5ea7a4e621028d2296a4dba0,openGorilla,2020-04-28T20:20:46.684Z,Especially since it's easier for younger people to learn new languages idk.
72,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7627d8,brightBison,2020-04-28T20:20:51.744Z,I don't think his family is being fair to him.
72,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631fe,excitedGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:21:06.694Z,"Being used like google translate for 8 years must have been very annoying for him. What is worse is that, after a while the family started to believe it is his duty. "
72,3,5ea8736c7d50722703c5247f,novelMonkey,2020-04-28T20:21:09.817Z,I think he could be more respectful of his mother-in-law
72,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7634d3,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T20:21:13.648Z,I can understand why she would feel upset but I don't think what she is doing is reasonable or sustainable. Being independent is important.
72,3,5ea7a4e621028d2296a4dba0,openGorilla,2020-04-28T20:21:36.305Z,"It sounds like the family is really resistant to seeing that learning even basic english would be better for everyone, which is a problem, though."
72,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631fe,excitedGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:21:37.878Z,I wish he had talked about the problem earlier... Not after dealing it with for 8 years.. 
72,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7627d8,brightBison,2020-04-28T20:21:52.083Z,She needs to learn some english and it is not racist to say so.
72,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631fe,excitedGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:21:53.402Z,"Nevertheless, he is not the asshole. "
72,3,5ea8736c7d50722703c5247f,novelMonkey,2020-04-28T20:22:11.435Z,I think depending on how he truly came across depends on if he was really being an asshole   
72,3,5ea7a4e621028d2296a4dba0,openGorilla,2020-04-28T20:22:11.544Z,"I don't know if he's been dealing with her for 8 years, it just said she's been there for 8."
72,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7627d8,brightBison,2020-04-28T20:22:23.398Z,I agree he is not an asshole.
72,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762d10,inquisitiveBear,2020-04-28T20:22:35.257Z,The mother is the asshole for refusing to not learn english after living in the US for over 8 years now.
72,3,5ea7a4e621028d2296a4dba0,openGorilla,2020-04-28T20:22:48.759Z,Wow.
72,3,5ea8736c7d50722703c5247f,novelMonkey,2020-04-28T20:22:50.698Z,I think hes just frustrated 
72,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631fe,excitedGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:22:52.467Z,"Yes, he did not ask her to learn English for his own sake, because it is the ""American"" language, but rather because she lives in a country where English is the most spoken language. "
72,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7627d8,brightBison,2020-04-28T20:23:11.552Z,It must get annoying after 8 years.
72,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631fe,excitedGiraffe,2020-04-28T20:23:36.570Z,It's too unfair to ask him to be full-time on-call translator. 
72,3,5d482ea621c9be351f7627d8,brightBison,2020-04-28T20:23:49.184Z,Maybe he should offer her direct tutoring.
72,3,5ea87ef27d50722703c5358e,delightedZebra,2020-04-28T20:23:57.262Z,This reminds me that actually that guy is not asshole. He suggested her to learn the language to tackle any situation by her own. He should communicate this with her wife and let her understand the actual meaning behind his thoughts. 
72,3,5ea7a4e621028d2296a4dba0,openGorilla,2020-04-28T20:23:57.761Z,"Again, I don't think he's been dealing with her for 8 years, especially since the last task said that they got married a few years ago."
72,3,5ea7a4e621028d2296a4dba0,openGorilla,2020-04-28T20:24:24.656Z,"He's not being a full on-time translator though. It's only ""sometimes"" for some quick things."
72,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7634d3,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T20:25:01.545Z,"That ""sometimes"" adds up"
72,3,5ea87ef27d50722703c5358e,delightedZebra,2020-04-28T20:25:36.570Z,Finally he is not assshole

73,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7633ec,inspiredMonkey,2020-04-28T19:13:15.135Z,"I agree after 8 years she should have more than a rudimentary understanding of english,"
73,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762cd9,openZebra,2020-04-28T19:13:37.744Z,"Agreed, I don't see any effort from her side"

73,0,5d482ea421c9be351f76239d,lightElephant,2020-04-28T19:13:56.329Z,I think he could have used more tact in telling her about learning English since she is the parent.
73,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7633ec,inspiredMonkey,2020-04-28T19:13:58.273Z,Yes no effort on her part.

73,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762773,curiousDolphin,2020-04-28T19:15:43.961Z,d be a good thing for the family if the mother would learn the language and show everyone she is happy to be with them.
73,0,5d482ea421c9be351f76239d,lightElephant,2020-04-28T19:15:49.759Z,I think thee should be a compromise from both where she accepts to learn English more and he is more understanding.

73,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763e48,eagerElephant,2020-04-28T19:25:39.673Z,but she shouldn't expect her husband to constantly help. just because she's busy doesn't mean it gets pushed to him

74,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762d1d,lightHippo,2020-04-28T19:27:18.217Z,This person is the asshole
74,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762239,inspiredHorse,2020-04-28T19:27:44.345Z,He is definitely the asshole. 
74,3,5ea8628c7d50722703c4e085,curiousBison,2020-04-28T19:27:48.027Z,yes
75,2,5e821b0450f6e364321d5460,novelGorilla,2020-04-28T18:26:25.695Z,"This reminds me a little of getting my nails done at my local salon, and the staff speaking Vietnamese."
75,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625d2,brightHippo,2020-04-28T18:26:31.624Z,I would feel uncomfortable to if two people started talking another language when you are hanging out in the room 
75,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625d2,brightHippo,2020-04-28T18:26:46.175Z,"Yes, Novel, me too, you cant help to think they are talking about you"
75,2,5ea63b6a7c882f6974ff320c,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-28T18:26:51.842Z,Mother felt left out of conversation. Son's husband could speak English so he should speak it if needed.  I compare it to whispering.
75,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762987,openOtter,2020-04-28T18:26:53.727Z,My initial impression is that the woman didn't feel included and couldn't speak to her son's partner because she doesn't know French.  Her son's partner knows English and should be polite and inlcude her in conversation. 
75,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625d2,brightHippo,2020-04-28T18:27:05.279Z,It would be one thing if she walked in on them already talking. I dont think shes the asshole
75,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762375,fulfilledZebra,2020-04-28T18:27:19.567Z,I feel very uncomfortable when I am out somewhere and excluded from a conversation because two people are speaking a different language

75,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762987,openOtter,2020-04-28T18:27:41.448Z,I think she was polite and right to speak up and tell them how she is feeling. 
75,2,5e821b0450f6e364321d5460,novelGorilla,2020-04-28T18:27:45.783Z,"I am not so sure, to be honest. I mean, they may have been discussing something completely innocuous, but it was easier to discuss in the husband's native language"
75,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762375,fulfilledZebra,2020-04-28T18:27:59.024Z,I do not feel like she is being an asshole but asking them to speak English in her home while they are visiting.
75,2,5ea868d67d50722703c4f7a7,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T18:28:02.154Z,I think she was calm and right to speak up and tell them how she is feeling
75,2,5e821b0450f6e364321d5460,novelGorilla,2020-04-28T18:28:09.802Z,She seemed to insinuate that the husband didn't speak English quite as well as her son spoke French.
75,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625d2,brightHippo,2020-04-28T18:28:10.558Z,I felt that she had the right to feel awkward and them making a big deal about it was rude.
75,2,5ea63b6a7c882f6974ff320c,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-28T18:28:11.593Z,If they were already talking when she walked in it would be different.  But she shouldn't be excluded.
75,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762987,openOtter,2020-04-28T18:28:12.318Z,"I don't think the son and his partner were trying to be rude, they are probably just very used to speaking in French now. "
75,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762375,fulfilledZebra,2020-04-28T18:28:29.346Z,"If they need to discuss something in private or so no one knows/hears, then maybe they should not be doing that in the living room."
75,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762987,openOtter,2020-04-28T18:28:39.254Z,"However, since everyone can speak English, and not French, I think they should use English in conversations when they're all in the living room together. That's just polite. "
75,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625d2,brightHippo,2020-04-28T18:28:47.549Z,I see your point openOtter but they could have been more understanding about it 
75,2,5e821b0450f6e364321d5460,novelGorilla,2020-04-28T18:28:52.912Z,"Yes, I doubt the intention was to exclude. It may not have even been a conscious thing to speak French."
75,2,5ea63b6a7c882f6974ff320c,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-28T18:29:01.991Z,"I agree.  If someone in the room doesn't speak French, they should speak English."
75,2,5e821b0450f6e364321d5460,novelGorilla,2020-04-28T18:29:24.511Z,"I think perhaps, ""What are we chatting about?"" might have been a better approach than to assume offense."
75,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762987,openOtter,2020-04-28T18:29:30.557Z,"I do consider both sides, I don't think anyone was purposely trying to be rude. It could be a comfort thing. "

75,2,5ea63b6a7c882f6974ff320c,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-28T18:29:58.785Z,"If they weren't intentionally doing it to exclude her, then they shouldn't have been upset when she asked them to speak English."
75,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762375,fulfilledZebra,2020-04-28T18:30:04.693Z,"I also don't think the son's husband should have walked away upset, because it honestly just looks bad on him."
75,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762987,openOtter,2020-04-28T18:30:08.687Z,"I think the next time they all get together, they should all speak in English. "
75,2,5e821b0450f6e364321d5460,novelGorilla,2020-04-28T18:30:19.550Z,I think it was more the 'you are being disrespectful'
75,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762987,openOtter,2020-04-28T18:30:43.356Z,"It is disrespectful though, to not include her in conversation. She must feel so awkward just sitting there. "

75,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762987,openOtter,2020-04-28T18:31:09.267Z,I wish we knew how long they were in the living room for

75,2,5ea63b6a7c882f6974ff320c,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-28T18:31:26.559Z,"If they didn't want her to hear it, they should have left the room."
75,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762375,fulfilledZebra,2020-04-28T18:31:37.355Z,It is hard without knowing how long they were in there before she walked in.
75,2,5e821b0450f6e364321d5460,novelGorilla,2020-04-28T18:31:44.587Z,What's our verdict?
75,2,5ea63b6a7c882f6974ff320c,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-28T18:31:57.345Z,I say not an asshole

75,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762987,openOtter,2020-04-28T18:32:26.357Z,I think she was put into an awkward situation

75,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762375,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-04-28T18:42:09.162Z,My first impression is that the young man and his husband are being assholes as they are being disrespectful in this situation.
75,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762987,livelyOtter,2020-04-28T18:42:09.435Z,I think the woman's husband doesn't feel comfortable speaking English and he may be nervous around his mother in law in general.  
75,3,5ea868d67d50722703c4f7a7,inspiredBear,2020-04-28T18:42:21.895Z,"I impressed this young woman isn't an asshole, she is trying to make her husband feel comfortable."

75,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762375,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-04-28T18:42:53.289Z,I feel like the mother has every right to be upset that she is being excluded from the conversations because her son is choosing to speak another language.

75,3,5e821b0450f6e364321d5460,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T18:43:28.367Z,I agree - I think the respectful thing to do would be for the son in law to practice his English.
75,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762375,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-04-28T18:43:43.074Z,"I agree with excitedBison yes his husband may not know the right words, but he could easily make everyone feel included by helping to translate the appropriate words."

75,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7625d2,curiousZebra,2020-04-28T18:43:51.132Z,I think if they are visiting they should make an effort to make her feel included

75,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762987,livelyOtter,2020-04-28T18:44:31.171Z,They can make her feel included in other ways

75,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762987,livelyOtter,2020-04-28T18:45:26.459Z,I think the woman had to make a choice and is trying to be more considerate of her husband here 
75,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7625d2,curiousZebra,2020-04-28T18:45:37.916Z,Ive never said the word asshole so much in my life lol

75,3,5e821b0450f6e364321d5460,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T18:45:44.436Z,ask.
75,3,5ea63b6a7c882f6974ff320c,excitedBison,2020-04-28T18:45:57.778Z,"Yes, asshole is a little strong in this situation.  But it comes down to excluding the mother, which is wrong, in my opinion.  I think the husband could be a little uncomfortable in his mother-in-laws house for a weekend."
75,3,5e821b0450f6e364321d5460,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T18:46:17.744Z,"I agree, excitedBison"

75,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762375,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-04-28T18:46:40.243Z,So we are all on agreement that the mother is not being an asshole?
75,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7625d2,curiousZebra,2020-04-28T18:47:01.769Z,"I don't think she is an asshole, someone does though because they voted yes "
75,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762987,livelyOtter,2020-04-28T18:47:03.608Z,No one is an asshole in this situation 
75,3,5ea63b6a7c882f6974ff320c,excitedBison,2020-04-28T18:47:26.316Z,Yes....well the son is leaning towards lol

75,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762987,livelyOtter,2020-04-28T18:47:37.994Z,The mom can include herself in other ways
76,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762435,fulfilledGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:40:45.736Z,"So my initial impression is that he is indeed an asshole.  The fact that he was able to learn all of those languages doesnt speak to his mother-in-law's ability.  In all reality, I'd see it as a sign of trust/respect to be consulted."
76,0,5ea0d8969dc0406f8988aeb0,livelyElephant,2020-04-28T17:40:51.829Z,"My first though is this guy is not the asshole for felling this way, but he was a little insensitive and could have handled it in a different way."
76,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762435,fulfilledGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:42:05.269Z,"This is the sort of thing that is signed up for when getting married.  There will be what one perceives to be 'inconvienances'.  Nobody asked him to learn their languages, he doesnt get to hold that over their heads."
76,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762bdf,openDolphin,2020-04-28T17:42:16.091Z,"I don't think the guy was the asshole. He clearly has been doing this for a long while, and it's to the point where it's disrupting his life. I think his attitude would be different if others in the family were also helping out."
76,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762814,inquisitiveHippo,2020-04-28T17:43:24.844Z,"Having to pick Yes or No without any more details, I would say Yes, he's an asshole. Just because he could teach himself different languages, doesn't have any bearing on his MIL. He came across as disrespectful."
76,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763594,delightedOtter,2020-04-28T17:43:35.293Z,"Being there when someone needs me,  love i live by. But being clear in situations only makes things easier for all parties. If his suggestion were something like a smartphone app that can translate for his extended family, would be ideal"
76,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762435,fulfilledGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:43:47.419Z,"Now to consider his side of it, yeah, its becoming a bit of a burden, and maybe adding to the disruption of his life a bit.  But back to the fact that it sounds like he didnt handle it well."
76,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763100,curiousGorilla,2020-04-28T17:44:07.482Z,I feel that although the MIL relies on his assistance  - his approach was not good and made him appear to be the asshole to the whole family.  
76,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762bdf,openDolphin,2020-04-28T17:44:07.879Z,It help me better understand his position when he added that he didn't speak to his MIL in a disrespectful way.
76,0,5d482ea521c9be351f762435,fulfilledGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:44:18.999Z,openDolphin - agreed

77,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763877,novelGorilla,2020-04-28T18:04:36.727Z,I agree inquisitiveHippo

Since that's the case, she needs to be open to other solutions to her mother's problem."
77,2,5ea861c47d50722703c4dd0d,inspiredDolphin,2020-04-28T18:05:31.782Z,Asshole?
77,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763877,novelGorilla,2020-04-28T18:05:37.569Z,This person IS the asshole

78,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7623ba,openGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:40:50.811Z,"So my take on this is it could go either way. But I lean more to her being an a-hole, because no where does it say that she discussed the translations needs with her husband."
78,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763718,delightedBison,2020-04-28T17:40:56.623Z,I am considering that the wife is TA because she is not setting boundries of her mom asking her husband. She should consider her husband's time.
78,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76251c,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T17:40:57.940Z,"Therefore, I think she's being a jerk, and it shows when she says she made fun of her husband for being white to begin with."

78,1,5ea7a48c21028d2296a4dae0,brightHippo,2020-04-28T17:41:20.288Z,My first impression is also that the wife is TA. How often is once in a while?
78,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7623ba,openGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:41:32.069Z,She assumed that her husband would be okay with it. And if you assume something it well it makes an ass out of u and me.
78,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763718,delightedBison,2020-04-28T17:41:39.130Z,"Even if he has spare time, the wife should ask before assuming and letting her mom just bothering the husband."

78,1,5ea0d3aa9dc0406f8988a14d,excitedGorilla,2020-04-28T17:41:58.079Z,He just assumed her husband would take it on now that they are married 
78,1,5ea7a48c21028d2296a4dae0,brightHippo,2020-04-28T17:42:05.169Z,Do the parents make any effort to learn some english? 
78,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7623ba,openGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:42:13.864Z,"Yes the husband should be willing to help, but it comes down to first having an open conversation and seeing if he would be willing to do so."
78,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76251c,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T17:42:15.055Z,She just made excuses as to why they aren't
78,1,5ea0d3aa9dc0406f8988a14d,excitedGorilla,2020-04-28T17:42:37.731Z,It may be hard for them to pick up the language 
78,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763718,delightedBison,2020-04-28T17:42:38.468Z,"10 minutes may not be a big deal, but still wife should have some consideration."
78,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76251c,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T17:42:41.614Z,Getting married does not mean you volunteer all your free time to your in-law's wants and needs.
78,1,5ea7a48c21028d2296a4dae0,brightHippo,2020-04-28T17:42:52.067Z,"Yes, the husband should help but if the parents make no effort to learn then it's not all on him."
78,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a0f,eagerHorse,2020-04-28T17:43:21.824Z,"Well, he is translating for them...they are making some effort"
78,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76251c,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T17:43:22.044Z,"I'm sure it was hard for him to pick up the language too, but he put in effort and made it happen. Anyone ever can learn a second language should they try."
78,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763718,delightedBison,2020-04-28T17:43:28.260Z,"Wife should help her parents first off and if she isn't able to, then ask the husband would it be okay if he helped. Give him the respect for that at least."
78,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7623ba,openGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:43:44.675Z,"If we assume it is just 10 minutes every once in a while just because she says it is, it probably isn't true... 10 minutes once in a while might be 1 day every couple of weeks in our mind, but whose to say that it isn't 2-3 times a week?"
78,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7623ba,openGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:43:48.193Z,Or more even.
78,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76251c,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T17:44:00.309Z,"Yes, she's very obviously disrespectful to him. She makes fun of him for being white, she doesn't consider his time, she consders her parent's struggles more thanher husband's"
78,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76286d,fulfilledElephant,2020-04-28T17:44:00.438Z,I think that it is wonderful how hard she works but she should make sure it doesn’t become her husband’s job all the time.
78,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76251c,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T17:44:26.003Z,Her husband is the low man on the totem pole and she's made that very clear.
78,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763718,delightedBison,2020-04-28T17:44:28.224Z,"Would she be annoyed if her husband parent's did the say? Hmm, I wonder?"
78,1,5ea7a48c21028d2296a4dae0,brightHippo,2020-04-28T17:44:39.526Z,Part of the problem is that she is underestimating how much time is once in a while.
78,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7623ba,openGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:44:40.118Z,"So yes the husband should be willing to do some stuff, but was absolutely wrong for her to just assume he's going to do so."
78,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a0f,eagerHorse,2020-04-28T17:44:56.173Z,so she is the asshole?
78,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76251c,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T17:44:58.423Z,Yes.
78,1,5ea7a48c21028d2296a4dae0,brightHippo,2020-04-28T17:45:04.230Z,I think she is
78,1,5ea0d3aa9dc0406f8988a14d,excitedGorilla,2020-04-28T17:45:06.233Z,I can say that if she may be doing an assignment like a test to quiz then I think that would a time to ask the husband to take the call 
78,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7623ba,openGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:45:14.123Z,"I agree, I imagine it isn't once in a while, it is probably a daily thing or weekly thing, and it is probably more than 10 minutes."
78,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76286d,fulfilledElephant,2020-04-28T17:45:24.814Z,Parents may have a dependence issue as well.
78,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76251c,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T17:45:27.837Z,I think mom could also just call back during a better time.
78,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7623ba,openGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:45:37.322Z,My vote is going to be a yes.
78,1,5ea0d3aa9dc0406f8988a14d,excitedGorilla,2020-04-28T17:45:42.891Z,I vote yes 
78,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762a0f,eagerHorse,2020-04-28T17:46:10.419Z,"I see both sides, but you guys persuaded me that she is the asshole"
78,1,5ea0d3aa9dc0406f8988a14d,excitedGorilla,2020-04-28T17:46:40.430Z,I see both sides as well but it's hard not to see she's being mean 
78,1,5ea7a48c21028d2296a4dae0,brightHippo,2020-04-28T17:46:50.713Z,We really need additional info but I say yes with what we have.

78,2,5d482ea621c9be351f76286d,brightBear,2020-04-28T17:55:55.812Z,I think the family shouldn’t be so upset with him but he needs to exercise patience.
78,2,5d482ea521c9be351f76251c,openHorse,2020-04-28T17:56:09.176Z,It's hard to have patience when people are not considerate of your time.
78,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762a0f,fulfilledZebra,2020-04-28T17:56:09.640Z,it seems unreasonable to ask to translate that much
78,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7623ba,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T17:56:13.372Z,There is a way to speak kindly and gently with a person without acting like an a-hole.

78,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763718,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T17:56:31.864Z,I can see how he frustrated on being the one to help out with translating and help the family member in law continuously. I think he could have said it in a better way and not so angrily I guess.
78,2,5ea7a48c21028d2296a4dae0,novelDolphin,2020-04-28T17:56:37.209Z,"If it is usually ""basic errands"", then yes they should spend the time learning some english to get through these tasks on their own."

78,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763718,lightMonkey,2020-04-28T17:57:09.708Z,I think that in law could have tried to learn some English in that amount of time though even it's just basic English of getting necessities.
78,2,5ea7a48c21028d2296a4dae0,novelDolphin,2020-04-28T17:57:12.682Z,He said he didn't actually say dealing with her shit in the edit

81,2,5d482eab21c9be351f76403b,excitedGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:37:01.633Z,I'm assuming she speaks no german but he can understand English. If there's to be any meaningful discourse it would have to be in English.
81,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c11,inquisitiveBear,2020-04-28T17:37:03.786Z,"It would also be very stressful on the son to have to translate between his mother and his husband. I think he should be able to have private conversations with his husband, even if they're in the mother's house."
81,2,5d482eab21c9be351f76403b,excitedGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:37:23.141Z,You could offer to translate for your husband while at your mom's.
81,2,5ea723c23ecdad55471ffbac,curiousHorse,2020-04-28T17:37:27.241Z,"They can have private conversations, however should excuse themselves to do so."
81,2,5ea1c1c0de5d74641b6708c2,openElephant,2020-04-28T17:37:36.261Z,Communication between the mother and son was the most important thing here.  She would have been much more understanding if he had told her.  The son should still try to include his mother as much as possible.
81,2,5ea854c27d50722703c4cc0c,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T17:37:37.728Z,"I think the son should just talk to his mom and while him and his husband are having a conversation, they should speak however they are comfortable."

81,2,5d482ea321c9be351f762157,lightBison,2020-04-28T17:38:38.146Z,I would assume he told his mother the situation. 
81,2,5d482ea321c9be351f762157,lightBison,2020-04-28T17:38:48.191Z,Its not like she is unaware of why he is speaking the way he is 
81,2,5ea854c27d50722703c4cc0c,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T17:38:54.963Z,But the mom should understand that they do not normally speak english.
81,2,5ea854c27d50722703c4cc0c,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T17:39:05.157Z,I feel he is NOT an asshole. 
81,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c11,inquisitiveBear,2020-04-28T17:39:10.658Z,You have to also consider the husbands point of view. He should't have to feel uncomfortable in his mother-in-law's house.

81,2,5ea854c27d50722703c4cc0c,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T17:40:05.227Z,My husband talks to his mom alone all the time. I don't see why he can't talk to his mom in english and his husband mostly in german
81,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c11,inquisitiveBear,2020-04-28T17:40:24.218Z,I don't feel like the son's the asshole. He should be able to have private conversations with his husband wherever they may be.
81,2,5d482ea321c9be351f762157,lightBison,2020-04-28T17:40:29.900Z,I am empathetic to his situation but I suppose he is an unintentional asshole.

82,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764217,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T16:40:37.965Z,I suspect that anyone who describes the situation with profanity is not actually as respectful as he claims
82,0,5ea761acfd339b022f9cebca,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T16:40:47.163Z,He needs to be more understanding of the mother in law's situation.

82,0,5ea72fac3ecdad5547201425,fulfilledOtter,2020-04-28T16:41:24.463Z,But how did she do it prior to him? Did he make her think he didn't mind translating?
82,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764217,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T16:41:32.251Z,I agree. Some people have a much more difficult time learning a language than others

82,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763107,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-04-28T16:42:03.199Z,Maybe he needs to help her find another translator instead of asking her to learn the language.  Google translate!
82,0,5ea855b27d50722703c4cc50,lightCamel,2020-04-28T16:42:31.262Z,He did offer to give her help though
82,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764217,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T16:42:45.513Z,I think that there could have been a much more gentle way he could have encouraged his MIL to try to learn English...MIL probablable feels humiliated she has to ask for help.
82,0,5ea854c27d50722703c4cc0d,inspiredZebra,2020-04-28T16:42:45.528Z,fulfilledOtter she may have relied on her daughter.

82,0,5d482eab21c9be351f764217,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T16:43:32.047Z,I can understand his frustration in that he doesn't think that his MIL is trying to learn the language

83,1,5ea6fa96002f966295b2007d,openMonkey,2020-04-28T16:46:49.455Z,I do think she should learn Engligh enough to be able to have a life though
83,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7641e1,livelyBison,2020-04-28T16:46:59.629Z,"I'm not trying to be combative, but have you ever lived in a foreign country?"
83,1,5ea734163ecdad5547202554,excitedOtter,2020-04-28T16:47:18.931Z,If I lived anywhere for 8 years it's customary to speak their predominant language 
83,1,5ea72d543ecdad5547200d0e,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T16:47:20.460Z,He just seems like an asshole. He could have totally approached the matter in a different. It's great he was able to pick up on different languages. Maybe he could reach out and tech them.
83,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7641e1,livelyBison,2020-04-28T16:47:26.115Z,"It's really disorienting, stressful, and anxiety inducing. Most of the time, you don't just ""pick up"" a language"
83,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fcb,brightCamel,2020-04-28T16:47:37.861Z,"i agree, marriage is about compromise. Learning a new language is no easy feat"
83,1,5ea6fa96002f966295b2007d,openMonkey,2020-04-28T16:47:43.621Z,"after 8 years, she should be able to at least have a limited conversation or take someone with her to translate"
83,1,5ea7a36021028d2296a4d669,curiousBear,2020-04-28T16:47:44.612Z,She lives in an area with mostly Spanish-speaking people so it seems like she might've been able to get around just fine without English.
83,1,5ea6fa96002f966295b2007d,openMonkey,2020-04-28T16:47:59.800Z,that's true curiousBear
83,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763420,inquisitiveHorse,2020-04-28T16:48:10.624Z,"It does not sound like she is out in the world a lot, otherwise she would be able to do more. If everyone around her speaks her own language, then it would be hard to learn English."
83,1,5ea734163ecdad5547202554,excitedOtter,2020-04-28T16:48:16.266Z,"Learning a new language is very difficult I know. It's been almost a decade, anyone with 8 years worth of time in a different country should be able to order food at the very least"
83,1,5ea7a36021028d2296a4d669,curiousBear,2020-04-28T16:48:47.398Z,"There's just going to be situations with more difficult vocabulary that she requires a translator. Even if she ""learned English"", with the rate of a second language acquisition, it'd be very difficult for her to prepare for these rare cases"
83,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7641e1,livelyBison,2020-04-28T16:48:56.180Z,"I have to say, I really disagree. I think it's easy to learn stuff like ""please"" and ""thanks"", but having a discussion is an entirely different matter."
83,1,5ea72d543ecdad5547200d0e,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T16:49:12.392Z,Also consider the fact English is the most difficult language to learn.
83,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7641e1,livelyBison,2020-04-28T16:49:21.378Z,"Yeah English makes no sense, gramatically. "
83,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763420,inquisitiveHorse,2020-04-28T16:49:38.299Z,"I feel he is in the wrong here. It does not sound like he is translating for her every day. And since he is obviously intelligent enough to know multiple languages, then maybe he should be the one teaching her. "
83,1,5ea734163ecdad5547202554,excitedOtter,2020-04-28T16:49:41.228Z,If it's occasionally she needs a translator then he is the asshole. But as he was stating it it's for essentially everything. What if the husband is busy? He has a life too and I think it's selfish if shes calling him every day to translate
83,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7641e1,livelyBison,2020-04-28T16:49:42.023Z,grammatically*
83,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7641e1,livelyBison,2020-04-28T16:50:00.096Z,Somehow I get the feeling he is exaggerating 
83,1,5ea7a36021028d2296a4d669,curiousBear,2020-04-28T16:50:00.312Z,"I do understand why he might be frustrated. Even though he isn't the only one that she goes to for translation, he might feel that because he is not blood family that does have the same obligation."
83,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763420,inquisitiveHorse,2020-04-28T16:50:20.966Z,"the post said ""sometimes calls me"""
83,1,5ea6fa96002f966295b2007d,openMonkey,2020-04-28T16:50:27.813Z,it sounded like it was only when no one else was available that it happened
83,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7641e1,livelyBison,2020-04-28T16:50:31.813Z,"I just can't imagine that this woman is calling him multiple times per day, per week. I too understand the frustration, but he is being a jerk."
83,1,5ea734163ecdad5547202554,excitedOtter,2020-04-28T16:50:37.431Z,If he is exaggerating then I agree he is the asshole
83,1,5ea72d543ecdad5547200d0e,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-28T16:50:41.483Z,Yep he's the asshole. Even reading his statement he sounds like an angry person.
83,1,5ea6fa96002f966295b2007d,openMonkey,2020-04-28T16:50:50.486Z,"yes, i think he's an asshole"
83,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7641e1,livelyBison,2020-04-28T16:51:10.035Z,Yeah def the asshole
83,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fcb,brightCamel,2020-04-28T16:51:13.383Z,He is an asshole for trying to impose his views on her.
83,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763420,inquisitiveHorse,2020-04-28T16:51:21.208Z,Everyone needs to vote.
83,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7641e1,livelyBison,2020-04-28T16:51:24.421Z,"Simple as that, for sure! "
83,3,5ea734163ecdad5547202554,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:15:26.408Z,Ok so in the situation I would say the author is the asshole by how they are handling it and not the action itself to make the husband translate.
83,3,5ea6fa96002f966295b2007d,novelZebra,2020-04-28T17:15:47.239Z,i think that having to translate once in a while shouldn't be that big of a deal
83,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763fcb,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-28T17:16:03.791Z,I think the author is an asshole for always nagging her husband to translate things and making him drop everything he is doing to do so. It is selfish and annoying.
83,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763420,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T17:16:16.101Z,The husband has more free time. The husband is part of the family. The husband needs to be supportive of his wife and her family since it is not a huge time requirement. 
83,3,5ea6fa96002f966295b2007d,novelZebra,2020-04-28T17:16:16.567Z,exactly
83,3,5ea7a36021028d2296a4d669,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T17:16:28.346Z,"If the man married the woman, then he agreed to support her. This is simply one of the areas that the wife feels that she needs support. It is his responsibility to help."
83,3,5ea7a36021028d2296a4d669,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T17:16:45.525Z,"Although I don't understand one part. If the wife is saying that it's not that big of a time commitment, then why can't she do it?"
83,3,5ea7a36021028d2296a4d669,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T17:17:00.176Z,"I understand that she's more busy than the husband, but if it's only 10 minutes then why can't she do it?"
83,3,5ea734163ecdad5547202554,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:17:05.182Z,Saying using rosetta stone or duolingo is a privilege is wrong because duolingo is free. Also I think it's hypocritical of the author to say he should step up to the plate for 10 minutes why cant she? Everybody has 10 minutes in a day
83,3,5ea6fa96002f966295b2007d,novelZebra,2020-04-28T17:17:07.115Z,the husband should be more willing to help her parents....it doesn't sem like it happens very often
83,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763420,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T17:17:08.046Z,"The wife works plus is going to school. The husband has more free time. He should be more than willing to help out. If this was a daily thing, or something that took hours, I could understand his frustration."
83,3,5ea734163ecdad5547202554,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:17:22.530Z,in
83,3,5ea6fa96002f966295b2007d,novelZebra,2020-04-28T17:17:33.354Z,i agree too
83,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763fcb,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-28T17:17:43.308Z,I understand that as well
83,3,5ea734163ecdad5547202554,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:18:01.611Z,inspiredOtter I agree with you. We are given a lack of information. I say if it truly is a few minutes once in a while its not big deal. If they are underplaying it and its hours a week then the author is the asshole
83,3,5ea72d543ecdad5547200d0e,brightBear,2020-04-28T17:18:02.606Z,I agree
83,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763420,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T17:18:17.011Z,"Agree, eagerGiraffe"
83,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763420,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T17:18:24.388Z,there is not enough information. 
83,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763420,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T17:18:39.076Z,"but with what is presented, he should step up. They are married, and it is called compromise. "
83,3,5ea6fa96002f966295b2007d,novelZebra,2020-04-28T17:18:48.354Z,exactly
83,3,5ea7a36021028d2296a4d669,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T17:18:51.807Z,I agree
83,3,5ea734163ecdad5547202554,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:19:07.712Z,Agree all of marriage is a compromise essentially
83,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763420,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T17:19:32.838Z,Wish we could assign partial idiocy :) 
83,3,5ea734163ecdad5547202554,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:19:56.864Z,In reddit there is ESH (everybody sucks here) as well as NHA (no asshole here) 
83,3,5ea72d543ecdad5547200d0e,brightBear,2020-04-28T17:20:11.107Z,So do we agree the wife is not the asshole?
83,3,5ea734163ecdad5547202554,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:20:13.675Z,but with either asshole or not asshole we have to assign it and id say not the asshole
83,3,5ea734163ecdad5547202554,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:20:26.345Z,yes brightBear
83,3,5ea6fa96002f966295b2007d,novelZebra,2020-04-28T17:20:30.420Z,yes
83,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763420,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T17:20:31.090Z,i agree. she is not.
83,3,5ea7a36021028d2296a4d669,excitedCamel,2020-04-28T17:20:37.712Z,She is not
83,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763420,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T17:21:10.804Z,Still a lot of votes out.
83,3,5ea734163ecdad5547202554,eagerGiraffe,2020-04-28T17:21:19.364Z,Everyone needs to vote for the study fellow animals 
84,1,5ea1d1a6de5d74641b671766,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T23:09:37.723Z,She could have said it differently
84,1,5ea872727d50722703c521d8,lightGiraffe,2020-04-28T23:09:54.013Z,Yes she could have approached it a different way.
84,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763987,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T23:10:13.903Z,I think she has a right to be shown respect because it's her house.
84,1,5ea872727d50722703c521d8,lightGiraffe,2020-04-28T23:10:15.793Z,Instead of stopping them in the middle of the conversation why could she just not talk to the son in private
84,1,5ea884567d50722703c53c2a,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T23:10:19.305Z,It is embarrassing to be in a room and not speak language
84,1,5ea7893e21028d2296a48cbe,delightedBear,2020-04-28T23:10:20.963Z,"She may be assuming his English is better than it actually is, but my initial impression is, they should not be having full conversations in front of her.  That leaves her out and is rude."
84,1,5d482ea721c9be351f763016,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-28T23:10:21.463Z,My initial impression was the the author was the asshole. This was because she could've said it differently. Or she could've asked if the partner was uncomfortable or shy about speaking english in front of them
84,1,5ea1d1a6de5d74641b671766,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T23:10:22.551Z,I dont think they were disrespectful
84,1,5ea1d1a6de5d74641b671766,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T23:10:40.068Z,"she couldve asked them to teach her, or she couldve make a lighthearted joke"
84,1,5ea884567d50722703c53c2a,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T23:10:56.516Z,I don't think they meant to be disrespectful but was embarrassing.
84,1,5ea872727d50722703c521d8,lightGiraffe,2020-04-28T23:11:11.551Z,Is it polite to sit there and have a conversation like that when someone else is around? probably not. But it's more rude to interrupt and try to call them out like that
84,1,5ea1d1a6de5d74641b671766,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T23:11:16.929Z,yeah I think maybe the husband was slightly embarassed
84,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7633d4,openElephant,2020-04-28T23:11:25.276Z,"The son and partner are staying at her house for a week. They could have been more considerate about language, particularly since the partner speaks English without much problem."
84,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763987,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T23:11:25.859Z,I agree that she should have had a private conversation with the son instead of stopping the conversation and pointing it out in the open.
84,1,5ea1d1a6de5d74641b671766,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T23:11:26.451Z,yeah
84,1,5ea7893e21028d2296a48cbe,delightedBear,2020-04-28T23:11:41.576Z,I see wrong on both ends
84,1,5ea884567d50722703c53c2a,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T23:11:47.774Z,"Yes, that is true she could have waited until later to mention it to son."
84,1,5d482ea721c9be351f763016,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-28T23:12:12.703Z,I think it would be okay to address it with the partner. But it seems like it could've been done in a less tense way maybe.
84,1,5ea884567d50722703c53c2a,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T23:12:17.344Z,I think the son's partner was overreacting
84,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763987,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T23:12:23.495Z,I can also understand her point especially because the partner speaks English.
84,1,5ea7893e21028d2296a48cbe,delightedBear,2020-04-28T23:12:23.597Z,"Her son told her she was making everyone feel awkward, whereas they were making her feel awkward."
84,1,5ea1d1a6de5d74641b671766,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T23:12:26.479Z,Thats like saying if you're not gonna speak the Queen's English dont talk at all...
84,1,5ea872727d50722703c521d8,lightGiraffe,2020-04-28T23:12:38.798Z,The partner is probably embarassed as well about not being able to speak English well- it could be definitely a good opportunity for the two of them to bond a bit. 
84,1,5ea1d1a6de5d74641b671766,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T23:12:54.858Z,I think the son didnt know how to react because he was embarsased instead of apologizing. 
84,1,5ea872727d50722703c521d8,lightGiraffe,2020-04-28T23:13:08.081Z,The whole thing is mad awkward lol
84,1,5ea1d1a6de5d74641b671766,livelyHorse,2020-04-28T23:13:13.006Z,yeahhhh
84,1,5ea884567d50722703c53c2a,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T23:13:21.336Z,The son should consider how it would make mom feel like a third wheel too.
84,1,5d482ea721c9be351f763016,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-28T23:13:25.506Z,"Yeah, I could see that the author felt excluded. Both sides could've addressed it better, I think"
84,1,5ea7893e21028d2296a48cbe,delightedBear,2020-04-28T23:13:29.304Z,"Again though, she says the husband speaks English, so either he doesn't speak English as well as she thinks, or he doesn't care to speak english.  I feel as if it's the latter, and that's rude."
84,1,5ea7893e21028d2296a48cbe,delightedBear,2020-04-28T23:13:39.200Z,Given the circumstance and situation.  Knowing she doesn't speak French.
84,1,5ea884567d50722703c53c2a,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T23:13:48.156Z,"Both overreacted, each side."
84,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763987,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T23:13:58.223Z,At first I would've said she wasn't at fault because it's her house and it is kind of rude to be speaking a different language and exclude her but this should have been handled in private and she wasn't being fair either.
84,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7633d4,openElephant,2020-04-28T23:14:14.723Z,The son could have done better in easing the situation...
84,1,5ea884567d50722703c53c2a,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T23:14:15.957Z,I agree with that
84,1,5d482ea721c9be351f763016,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-28T23:14:24.313Z,I agree with curiousHippo
84,1,5ea7893e21028d2296a48cbe,delightedBear,2020-04-28T23:14:56.221Z,I am leaning towards her not being the asshole.  Because the situation was started by the son and his husband.  They should have known better.
84,1,5ea7893e21028d2296a48cbe,delightedBear,2020-04-28T23:15:23.141Z,If they wouldn't have had a conversation in front of her in another language this wouldn't have happened.  Regardless of them all being wrong afterwards.
84,1,5ea884567d50722703c53c2a,inspiredGorilla,2020-04-28T23:15:28.250Z,Son is at fault.
84,1,5d482ea721c9be351f763016,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-04-28T23:15:32.240Z,I feel like there was assholery on both sides
84,1,5ea872727d50722703c521d8,lightGiraffe,2020-04-28T23:15:35.871Z,It's his partner's primary language
84,1,5ea872727d50722703c521d8,lightGiraffe,2020-04-28T23:15:49.085Z,They were both buttholes but she was more rude
84,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763987,curiousHippo,2020-04-28T23:15:51.543Z,I said yes that she was but it's very marginal. I could see people saying the opposite. 
84,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7633d4,openElephant,2020-04-28T23:16:06.933Z,I think as a visitor the partner could have tried to speak English more even if he was embarrassed
84,1,5ea872727d50722703c521d8,lightGiraffe,2020-04-28T23:16:13.986Z,Love you guys though
84,2,5ea7893e21028d2296a48cbe,curiousCamel,2020-04-28T23:24:56.858Z,"Taking into consideration everything in the article, she could have told her mom in advance why she'd be speaking in German, and how her husband felt. Maybe then her mom would understand.  And if not she could always translate for her mom."
84,2,5d482ea721c9be351f763016,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-28T23:25:07.967Z,This was really tricky for me because I could see both sides. I felt like they all just needed to sit down before the visit and have a long talk and each side compromise a little.
84,2,5ea1d1a6de5d74641b671766,livelyHippo,2020-04-28T23:25:09.951Z,"I think she has good ntentions, but her impact is bad. Shes  TA not bc she speaks German too, but because she intentionall excludeds her mom she could speak both when at her moms."
84,2,5ea872727d50722703c521d8,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-28T23:25:17.972Z,"My opinion is that if the mother is hosting them and providing meals, they should have made the conscious effort to include the mother more in the conversation. "
84,2,5ea1d1a6de5d74641b671766,livelyHippo,2020-04-28T23:25:27.286Z,A way to collaborate instead of compromise
84,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763987,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T23:25:27.744Z,I think this person is an asshole because the mother is letting them stay at her house and is feeding them too and I don't understand why he has to choose between making his mother or husband comfortable.
84,2,5ea7893e21028d2296a48cbe,curiousCamel,2020-04-28T23:25:52.707Z,"That is true, and it'd be a great opportunity for him to further refine learning English"
84,2,5ea1d1a6de5d74641b671766,livelyHippo,2020-04-28T23:25:59.014Z,"I see no reason why not to speak both, why does it have to be one or the other"
84,2,5ea1d1a6de5d74641b671766,livelyHippo,2020-04-28T23:26:11.839Z,I agree with cur

84,2,5ea884567d50722703c53c2a,lightZebra,2020-04-28T23:26:14.858Z,I think that the son should have explained first to the mom the situation.  The son could spend some time with the mom interpretating and some time in private.
84,2,5ea1d1a6de5d74641b671766,livelyHippo,2020-04-28T23:26:17.004Z,curiousCamel
84,2,5d482ea721c9be351f763016,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-28T23:26:27.836Z,That's a good point that it could've helped him refine his english more
84,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763987,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T23:26:29.765Z,The husband understands English and obviously speaks it but I can see why he would feel more comfortable speaking German.
84,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7633d4,openBear,2020-04-28T23:26:29.923Z,I think she is an asshole in that she doesn't think she could have done anything more to help both her husband and her mom...
84,2,5ea884567d50722703c53c2a,lightZebra,2020-04-28T23:27:05.680Z,The partner should be willing to speak some English since he is staying at her house.
84,2,5ea872727d50722703c521d8,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-28T23:27:11.715Z,"I think she ""is the asshole"" - she could have figured out a way to find a common ground between the mom and the partner. "
84,2,5d482ea721c9be351f763016,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-28T23:27:25.554Z,It didn't sound like the son or daughter explained the situation to the mom. and I thought they were the asshole for not having that discussion to try to find common ground
84,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763987,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T23:27:33.644Z,The mom is doing everything to make them feel at home so him excluding her isn't right.
84,2,5ea7893e21028d2296a48cbe,curiousCamel,2020-04-28T23:27:38.827Z,"The article really makes it seem as if she is unwilling to compromise to please her husband, while putting out her own mother who is hosting them. I believe she is TA."
84,2,5ea872727d50722703c521d8,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-28T23:27:44.030Z,Exactly
84,2,5d482ea721c9be351f763016,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-28T23:27:47.720Z,I'd agree

84,2,5ea884567d50722703c53c2a,lightZebra,2020-04-28T23:28:05.809Z,The son seems immature saying partner comes first.  Shouldn't visit mom if he was going to be rude.
84,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7633d4,openBear,2020-04-28T23:28:18.869Z,she could always speak german with her husband in private...
84,2,5ea872727d50722703c521d8,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-28T23:28:47.742Z,"Yeah even if you aren't comfortable with it, just give it an hour and try- just to make the mom feel better at the very least"
84,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763987,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T23:28:55.467Z,I think it's very immature and there's no reason why there couldn't be some sort of compromises made. Neither the partner or the mom had to be excluded. They both could've learned from each other too.
84,2,5ea884567d50722703c53c2a,lightZebra,2020-04-28T23:29:13.597Z,"Yes, the son and his partner need to give a little bit"

84,2,5d482ea721c9be351f763016,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-28T23:30:15.617Z,"My vote would be the person is ""the asshole"" because I think the son and his partner should've talked this over with the mom instead of just excluding her."
84,2,5ea7893e21028d2296a48cbe,curiousCamel,2020-04-28T23:30:31.243Z,seems like everyone is in agreeance
84,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763987,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-28T23:30:31.485Z,I voted that they are the asshole because of their unwillingness to compromise.
84,2,5ea872727d50722703c521d8,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-28T23:30:43.099Z,I also voted asshole
84,2,5ea872727d50722703c521d8,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-28T23:30:55.939Z,A conscious effort was made to exclude the mother

85,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b94,novelGiraffe,2020-04-28T23:31:27.799Z,So this guy finally gets a chance to see his family and decides to not speak a language his mom can understand.

85,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762e4f,inquisitiveBear,2020-04-28T23:32:22.356Z,He was either going to make his mom feel uncomfortable or his husband feel uncomfortable.
85,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763240,brightGorilla,2020-04-28T23:32:23.105Z,I  imagine her mom sitting during lunch and be an aline

85,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762c0a,fulfilledOtter,2020-04-28T23:32:56.184Z,the thing is he can always use both languages and translates conversation for both people
85,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762e4f,inquisitiveBear,2020-04-28T23:33:05.544Z,He could have helped his mom by showing her how to use a translator on the phone and making it fun for her. 
85,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762c0a,fulfilledOtter,2020-04-28T23:33:17.069Z,and explain to his mother after talking in german
85,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b94,novelGiraffe,2020-04-28T23:33:18.279Z,I like that google translate idea
85,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763684,eagerBison,2020-04-28T23:33:19.986Z,"When she got married, she left her mother and became one with him and he comes first. She can talk to her mom when they are alone having girl time."
85,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f30,delightedElephant,2020-04-28T23:33:23.377Z,She could talk with her mother and explain that his English isn't the best and to be understanding. I get being embarrassed but they are in an English speaking house.
85,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763240,brightGorilla,2020-04-28T23:33:55.306Z,so what is  final decision

85,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f30,delightedElephant,2020-04-28T23:34:04.603Z,Asshole
85,2,5d482ea521c9be351f762430,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T23:34:06.456Z,The partner can take it as an opportunity to feel more comfortable in his English by taking risks in what could be a more supportive environment.
85,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f30,delightedElephant,2020-04-28T23:34:14.620Z,Exactly! I agree
85,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762e4f,inquisitiveBear,2020-04-28T23:34:16.868Z,"Tell the mom husband feels uncomfortable speaking English, as a mom she should understand."
85,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763684,eagerBison,2020-04-28T23:34:31.585Z,It maybe a good thing to speak german because mom maybe trying to be all in their relationship.
85,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763240,brightGorilla,2020-04-28T23:34:43.310Z,its a point too
85,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f30,delightedElephant,2020-04-28T23:34:51.167Z,"The best way to learn is to practice conversation, would be a good time to brush up on his English in a non-judgemental environment"
85,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763240,brightGorilla,2020-04-28T23:34:58.374Z, may be she is too lazy to translate all the time to her mom.
85,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b94,novelGiraffe,2020-04-28T23:35:17.316Z,The husband can man up too and try to speak english
85,2,5d482ea521c9be351f762430,excitedHorse,2020-04-28T23:35:17.647Z,Which is why all of them speaking the same language would be beneficial.

85,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762a8f,excitedZebra,2020-04-28T23:46:26.110Z,thoughts?
85,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b94,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T23:46:34.630Z,She's not an asshole
85,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e4f,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T23:46:39.096Z,"Definitely not an asshole, just wanting to know what the convo is and wanting to participate."
85,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f30,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-28T23:46:41.181Z,I don't think shes being an asshole. She wants to talk to her son and everyone be included in conversation. The son is there to translate if needed
85,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762a8f,excitedZebra,2020-04-28T23:46:47.896Z,i agree. not an asshole
85,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762a8f,excitedZebra,2020-04-28T23:46:54.392Z,she wasn't rude about
85,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762c0a,eagerGorilla,2020-04-28T23:46:58.080Z,She is not the asshole
85,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b94,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T23:47:03.124Z,it's disrespectful to speak a seperate language around someone who WANTS to be included in a conversation and means well
85,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e4f,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T23:47:09.719Z,She hasn't seen her child in a while and wanted to know what was going on in his life.
85,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762c0a,eagerGorilla,2020-04-28T23:47:23.702Z,The fact that she nicely told her child about the issue makes her not the asshole.
85,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e4f,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T23:47:50.203Z,"Yeah, I agree. She was nice and really, they came all that way to see her and she literally has no idea what they are talking about. "
85,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b94,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T23:48:06.075Z,For them to storm off when someone just wants to be included shows who the real asshole is.
85,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f30,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-28T23:48:16.881Z,"Yeah, I understand the partner might not be as comfortable in English but he's in an environment where thats okay"
85,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e4f,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T23:48:27.939Z,He could always put some of the German language in their convo to help husband.
85,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f30,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-28T23:49:00.819Z,"Exactly, the son obviously speaks both, why can't he translate for the both of them?"
85,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e4f,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T23:49:01.816Z,"Yeah, I agree, storming off is not an answer but why come all that way to speak a language the person you came to see doesn't understand?"
85,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e4f,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T23:49:24.401Z,"Yes, he could translate, and keep her part of the conversation. "
85,3,5d482ea921c9be351f763684,fulfilledBison,2020-04-28T23:49:47.488Z,"I don't know whose the asshole here, it could be the son or the partner"
85,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e4f,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T23:49:56.969Z,"I vote the mother is not an asshole, just wanting to catch up with her son and get to know his partner."
85,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762a8f,excitedZebra,2020-04-28T23:50:00.117Z,they all speak english so it's not as though his partner can't he just may not be as comfortable. she should be respectful of this but its not wrong to want to be included
85,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e4f,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T23:50:26.858Z,"Even if he can't speak it well, the son can help partner out."
85,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762c0a,eagerGorilla,2020-04-28T23:50:55.575Z,Mother's not the asshole
85,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e4f,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T23:51:25.251Z,"Agreed, mom's not an asshole. "
85,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b94,livelyDolphin,2020-04-28T23:51:33.392Z,I think the mom is NOT an asshole
85,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e4f,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T23:52:07.705Z,So we're all in agreement.
85,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f30,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-28T23:52:19.041Z,The mom is not an asshole
85,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e4f,inspiredOtter,2020-04-28T23:52:35.473Z,"Thanks, guys, for the helpful thoughts."
86,1,5d482ea421c9be351f762258,openCamel,2020-04-29T00:16:02.785Z,I think she's an asshole for forcing her husband to do this by himself. He didn't sign up for this. She should at least help sometimes.
86,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e3,eagerGorilla,2020-04-29T00:16:18.361Z,"I feel that she is partially the asshole for shoving it all onto her husband, and I do not agree that ""But he's married me, so my mom is his family too"" mentality"
86,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762150,fulfilledZebra,2020-04-29T00:16:22.925Z,"I don't think they are the asshole.   I think the initial request was from a good natured place, the tone has taken a turn for the worse, but that doesn't rise to the level of asshole."
86,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e2,brightHorse,2020-04-29T00:16:25.389Z,"The husband should help his mother-in-law because they are all one family. The writer should not cloud the issue by suggesting that it's only 10 minutes. But, they are family."
86,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7621f0,excitedDolphin,2020-04-29T00:16:47.164Z,I think she's an asshole for making her husband perform tasks on his own time and forcing him to put his life on hold. 
86,1,5d482ea421c9be351f762258,openCamel,2020-04-29T00:17:01.619Z,I think she should at least help sometimes though.
86,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762bba,curiousElephant,2020-04-29T00:17:26.816Z,I feel she is partially to blame for not asking if her husband minds helping. I also didn't like the fact that her logic was that since her married he he should always have to help
86,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e2,brightHorse,2020-04-29T00:17:37.670Z,"The husband has more free time, so is not putting his life on hold. Now, if he could set boundaries and schedule time specifically for these tasks as they arise."
86,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e3,eagerGorilla,2020-04-29T00:17:45.468Z,If only we could say that they are both the asshole like the subreddit.
86,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7621f0,excitedDolphin,2020-04-29T00:17:52.887Z,"I mean that's true, help out here and there, but if her husband has gotten increasingly irritated after constant translations then she's doing this more often than usual."
86,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7621f0,excitedDolphin,2020-04-29T00:18:13.782Z,But it's more like everyone sucks here to be quite honest.
86,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7621f0,excitedDolphin,2020-04-29T00:18:55.100Z,Maybe they need to work out a timed schedule/communication more to ensure that his life doesn't get put on hold while he's also helping her out.
86,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e2,brightHorse,2020-04-29T00:18:57.633Z,"I agree with eagerGorilla They are both being unreasonable with their extreme ""my-way-only"" attitudes."
86,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762150,fulfilledZebra,2020-04-29T00:19:02.658Z,"I feel like the tone is problematic at the end, but maybe this was in the heat of the moment after an argument, and the story is clouded."
86,1,5d482ea421c9be351f762258,openCamel,2020-04-29T00:19:26.510Z,I agree they need to work something out so the load is not all on him.
86,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762150,fulfilledZebra,2020-04-29T00:19:32.950Z,"I feel like he helps out, but got annoyed like most married people do with their in-laws, shared his opinion and she clapped back."
86,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762bba,curiousElephant,2020-04-29T00:19:39.784Z,It would help if she specified how much free time her husband has. It could turn out that he doesn't have as much free time as she thinks
86,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762150,fulfilledZebra,2020-04-29T00:19:42.365Z,"They need to work something out, but does that make someone an asshole?"
86,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762150,fulfilledZebra,2020-04-29T00:19:59.510Z,If I have a disagreement with my spouse is someone always an asshole?
86,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7621f0,excitedDolphin,2020-04-29T00:20:08.812Z,I feel like it's mostly YTA/ESH
86,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e2,brightHorse,2020-04-29T00:20:10.702Z,I still don't think she's an asshole for expecting him to help his mother-in-law.
86,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762150,fulfilledZebra,2020-04-29T00:20:36.521Z,I agree with bri
86,1,5d482ea421c9be351f762258,openCamel,2020-04-29T00:20:40.317Z,I think this makes her sound like an asshole because it sounds like she is not considering his feelings about this at all. She thinks it's his obligation and of course he has to do this. He has no choice.
86,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e2,brightHorse,2020-04-29T00:21:36.733Z,"I think that looking at the issue - should he help him mother-in-law - yes, he should. And the wife is not an asshole to ask."
86,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762150,fulfilledZebra,2020-04-29T00:22:05.294Z,I have seen worse. 
86,3,5d482ea321c9be351f762150,delightedGorilla,2020-04-29T00:45:42.941Z,I think this one comes down to whether you believe someone should learn the language or not.
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762258,eagerHorse,2020-04-29T00:45:54.193Z,This is a hard spot for him to be in but it sounds like he was rude to them even though he said he was respectful in the edit.
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e3,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-29T00:46:03.864Z,If she has to have help she needs to learn the language
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e2,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T00:46:14.624Z,"I think that what makes him an asshole is his attitude. He says he spoke to her with respect, but I don't think so. I seems this type of thing happens a lot. And he can't hide is frustration anymore."
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e3,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-29T00:46:35.630Z,If we trust him that he spoke with respect hes not the asshole.
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e3,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-29T00:46:46.440Z,but that's opinion
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7621f0,lightBear,2020-04-29T00:46:49.293Z,"Everyone sucks here/Your the asshole. I understand that people need to be independent in life to get through challenges, but you’re an asshole for suggesting that she should just do it on her own and just “learn it”. "
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7621f0,lightBear,2020-04-29T00:46:57.023Z,It’s not so easy for some people to learn a new language right away (especially at an older age) and sometimes impossible for some due to time constraints.
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7621f0,lightBear,2020-04-29T00:47:03.876Z,"I feel like if you would offer to help her learn it with her, then that would make you less of an asshole since she trusts you enough to ask you for guidance when translating. "
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762258,eagerHorse,2020-04-29T00:47:26.391Z,"I think she should learn the language too, but it's very difficult when you're older. I think whether he was an asshole depends how he approached her with this suggestion."
86,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762bba,novelOtter,2020-04-29T00:47:41.337Z,"To be fair, according to him he offered to help her in learning the language. He also said it was the whole family that needed to learn, not just her."
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7621f0,lightBear,2020-04-29T00:47:58.210Z,Yeah that's my thoughts exactly. I wish he would help her personally since she trusts him enough to ask him for help.
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e2,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T00:48:03.100Z,"I teach ESL and think folks should make the effort. But not everyone is as good with languages as this husband. And the point is that he's letting his belief that she should learn English, cloud the fact that she's his MIA. Just help her. "
86,3,5d482ea321c9be351f762150,delightedGorilla,2020-04-29T00:48:31.064Z,I don't think he is an asshole in terms of his thoughts at all.
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7621f0,lightBear,2020-04-29T00:48:40.474Z,That's true
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e3,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-29T00:48:49.345Z,"I do not completely trust him that he is explaining his issues in a calm fashion, and that he is phrasing in a respectful manner."
86,3,5d482ea321c9be351f762150,delightedGorilla,2020-04-29T00:48:52.087Z,I feel like it is just about tone.
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762258,eagerHorse,2020-04-29T00:49:01.202Z,I'm in this position of helping my parents. The problem is it's not just a few hours a week. It feels like a second job. It can take hours each time and it usually happens several times a week.
86,3,5d482ea321c9be351f762150,delightedGorilla,2020-04-29T00:49:02.745Z,Is being an asshole about tone or what you truly believe?
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7621f0,lightBear,2020-04-29T00:49:31.395Z,I think it's his tone that does make him sound like an asshole tbh
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762258,eagerHorse,2020-04-29T00:49:41.124Z,I agree the tone is bad.
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e2,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T00:49:44.856Z,"For me, it's about the tone. I work with people I don't like all the time. But I have to keep a civil tone."
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e3,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-29T00:49:45.467Z,"His beliefs are reasonable, they should have learned the language rather than rely on their daughter for so many years."
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7621f0,lightBear,2020-04-29T00:49:50.314Z,His thoughts are understandable but the way he executed them are terrible
86,3,5d482ea321c9be351f762150,delightedGorilla,2020-04-29T00:50:21.946Z,"Well it depends on how he truly conveyed the message, which isn't clear."
86,3,5d482ea321c9be351f762150,delightedGorilla,2020-04-29T00:50:31.205Z,Reading between the lines suggests condescension
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e2,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T00:50:36.192Z,I think he should try to set some boundaries for when he can help out in this way.
86,3,5d482ea321c9be351f762150,delightedGorilla,2020-04-29T00:50:38.908Z,But it is not necessarily true.
86,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762bba,novelOtter,2020-04-29T00:51:03.600Z,Also seems her family took things to far. Just because he said they should learn English doesn't make him a racist. Only problem is if he is being honest about how he brought it up
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e3,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-29T00:51:17.224Z,"Im not going to read to far into it, just gonna trust him"
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762258,eagerHorse,2020-04-29T00:51:56.772Z,I think it all comes down to whether you believe his edit.
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762258,eagerHorse,2020-04-29T00:52:06.915Z,I think he just added that because he was probably getting attacked in the comments.
86,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7622e3,livelyGiraffe,2020-04-29T00:52:08.779Z,Yep.
87,2,5d482ea321c9be351f7620a0,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-29T00:33:00.259Z,My initial thought is there are a lot of cultural implications and that the writer is not an asshole.
87,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f08,excitedElephant,2020-04-29T00:33:03.505Z,RIght off the bat I don't think the point that America is a country of immigrants helps OP
87,2,5d482ea321c9be351f762055,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-29T00:33:08.271Z,This person doesn't have a right to demand anyone do this for her parents
87,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762297,delightedBear,2020-04-29T00:33:10.791Z,I think that her husband should be willing to help her parents
87,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762323,curiousDolphin,2020-04-29T00:33:39.166Z,i think the husband should quit complaining and just do it.
87,2,5d482ea321c9be351f7620a0,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-29T00:34:01.977Z,"I think in relationships there are give and takes and marrying into Latinx culture, the big emphasis is family is very close and supports one another, which is something the husband might not get."

87,2,5d482ea321c9be351f762055,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-29T00:34:11.038Z,The person also uses marriage as a reason the husband is responsible to work as a translator for her parents

87,2,5d482ea321c9be351f7620a0,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-29T00:34:51.838Z,Yeah there doesn't seem to be a lot of perspective taking from the author or the husband
87,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762323,curiousDolphin,2020-04-29T00:35:12.643Z,the husband might just think that he does not have the time to do it.
87,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762297,delightedBear,2020-04-29T00:35:14.790Z,They said the husband has more time on his hands than her
87,2,5d482ea321c9be351f762055,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-29T00:35:18.198Z,No one has the right to dictate how another person spends their time
87,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f08,excitedElephant,2020-04-29T00:35:29.416Z,"I could see having the husband translate sometimes, but just all the time seems to be taking advantage"
87,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762297,delightedBear,2020-04-29T00:35:58.375Z,Are they taking advantage or is he over exaggerating 
87,2,5d482ea321c9be351f7620a0,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-29T00:36:01.307Z,I wonder if they discussed things like this prior to getting married.  A lot of marriages fail over broken communication and expectations.
87,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762323,curiousDolphin,2020-04-29T00:36:14.116Z,"he should just do it to be nice and keep the peace, for his marriage."
87,2,5d482ea321c9be351f762055,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-29T00:36:19.805Z,Immature the husband would freely do it occasionally if he didnt feel obligated to do it
87,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f08,excitedElephant,2020-04-29T00:36:26.154Z,Well OP did say that they just give the husband the phone because they are too busy
87,2,5d482ea321c9be351f762055,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-29T00:36:27.725Z,*I'm sure
87,2,5d482ea321c9be351f7620a0,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-29T00:36:28.256Z,Also the fact that the mother is calling the husband as opposed to her child is a topic of interest
87,2,5d482ea421c9be351f762323,curiousDolphin,2020-04-29T00:37:04.944Z,"yes, the mother might like him better."
87,2,5d482ea321c9be351f7620a0,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-29T00:37:05.238Z,"Almost like he feels it's been forced upon him, not something he's asked to do."
87,2,5d482ea321c9be351f7620a0,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-29T00:37:28.706Z,But at the same time I would love to support my mother-in-law in that situation if I could.
87,2,5d482ea321c9be351f762055,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-29T00:37:29.861Z,"The person explains only her schedule as being busy but mentions nothing of the husbands, possibly an attempt to bias the observer"
87,2,5d482ea321c9be351f7620a0,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-29T00:38:07.126Z,Everyone who posts these stories always tries to bias the reader towards their side.
87,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f08,excitedElephant,2020-04-29T00:38:11.092Z,"Right that is the thing that bugs me most, sometimes helping translate is alright, but why should he do it ALL the time"
87,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f08,excitedElephant,2020-04-29T00:38:36.114Z,"I think OP is an asshole, albeit a slight one"
87,2,5d482ea321c9be351f762055,inquisitiveBison,2020-04-29T00:38:46.637Z,This person is the asshole for forcing expectations on her husband that are her own responsibility
87,3,5d482ea321c9be351f762055,lightGorilla,2020-04-29T00:47:52.884Z,My impression is that he could have just declined
87,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f08,excitedHorse,2020-04-29T00:47:58.544Z,"This is a tough one, I think I'd have to side with the OP though"
87,3,5d482ea321c9be351f7620a0,fulfilledBison,2020-04-29T00:48:17.439Z,"I think based on the way he presented his argument, he is an asshole."
87,3,5d482ea321c9be351f762055,lightGorilla,2020-04-29T00:48:19.205Z,There was no reason for him to tell the mother what he wanted her to do
87,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762323,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-29T00:48:22.212Z,he could have night said no nicely.
87,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f08,excitedHorse,2020-04-29T00:48:22.976Z,8 years is a long time for someone to live somewhere and only pick up a few phrases
87,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762297,brightZebra,2020-04-29T00:48:24.112Z,I think that he should be more considerate and help
87,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f08,excitedHorse,2020-04-29T00:48:37.423Z,He clarified at the end that he was polite
87,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762323,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-29T00:48:42.468Z,he could have found a teacher for her.
87,3,5d482ea321c9be351f762055,lightGorilla,2020-04-29T00:48:52.819Z,"He could have declined without telling her what she ""should"" do"
87,3,5d482ea321c9be351f7620a0,fulfilledBison,2020-04-29T00:48:58.058Z,Just because you are polite doesn't mean you can dictate what others can/should do.
87,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762323,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-29T00:49:15.700Z,8 years is along time not to learn english.
87,3,5d482ea321c9be351f762055,lightGorilla,2020-04-29T00:49:38.123Z,You can politely tell someone to not talk anymore. Doesn't mean that you're showing respect. 
87,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762323,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-29T00:49:43.878Z,he should probably just do it to keep the peace.
87,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f08,excitedHorse,2020-04-29T00:49:48.584Z,8 years is more than enough time to learn enough english to be conversational
87,3,5d482ea321c9be351f7620a0,fulfilledBison,2020-04-29T00:50:09.650Z,"Some people have a hard time learning things as well, especially in areas where the population is still predominantly Latinx"
87,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f08,excitedHorse,2020-04-29T00:50:12.079Z,"I understand they come from different cultures, but come on"
87,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762297,brightZebra,2020-04-29T00:50:12.148Z,If they are not emerged in the culture it may be difficult
87,3,5d482ea321c9be351f762055,lightGorilla,2020-04-29T00:50:19.126Z,The bottom line for me is that he made it personal and didn't have to. He could have declined.
87,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762323,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-29T00:50:19.508Z,he could learn a little more tact.
87,3,5d482ea321c9be351f7620a0,fulfilledBison,2020-04-29T00:50:34.917Z,That's a big point lightGorilla
87,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f08,excitedHorse,2020-04-29T00:50:47.713Z,If I knew that I would be spending the rest of my life in a foreing country then I would make a great effort to learn te language
87,3,5d482ea321c9be351f762055,lightGorilla,2020-04-29T00:51:20.930Z,He also then compared his own accomplishments and assumed that everyone should have his aptitude
87,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762323,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-29T00:51:24.788Z,yes he made it personal and hurt her feelings.
87,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f08,excitedHorse,2020-04-29T00:51:30.213Z,He did however come across like a jerk in the post
87,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f08,excitedHorse,2020-04-29T00:51:54.522Z,Yeah that part was a little ridiculous
87,3,5d482ea321c9be351f7620a0,fulfilledBison,2020-04-29T00:52:10.098Z,Just because it took him a year to learn Spanish doesn't mean it's easy for them to learn English.  He could have learned with formalized instruction.
87,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f08,excitedHorse,2020-04-29T00:52:43.648Z,True
87,3,5d482ea321c9be351f7620a0,fulfilledBison,2020-04-29T00:52:55.211Z,"I have tried using DuoLingo to learn different languages and it is not easy unless you do it constantly.  It is very repetitious, at least in the beginning."
87,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f08,excitedHorse,2020-04-29T00:53:14.828Z,I'm leaning towards asshole because of his approach in handling the situation
87,3,5d482ea321c9be351f7620a0,fulfilledBison,2020-04-29T00:53:29.941Z,"I believe based on sentiment, even though he said he was nice to her, he is an asshole."
87,3,5d482ea321c9be351f762055,lightGorilla,2020-04-29T00:53:39.368Z,His own personal beliefs seems to intrude on his ability to respect another person's life decisions
87,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762323,inquisitiveElephant,2020-04-29T00:53:43.639Z,i think he is the asshole.
88,0,5d482ea321c9be351f7620b3,inquisitiveOtter,2020-04-29T00:08:52.323Z,"I think he has a right to be frustrated, but based on the rest of his post he was not as polite and respectful as he claimed."
88,0,5d482ea421c9be351f7621d2,novelCamel,2020-04-29T00:09:31.646Z,"I agree, what does everyone else think?"
88,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762d97,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-29T00:09:31.771Z,The MIL should be learning English by living here.  Probably is hard but we all have to learn as we go.
88,0,5d482ea321c9be351f761f92,curiousBear,2020-04-29T00:09:41.292Z,I feel like this is a big difference between saying what you mean and meaning what you say. the way it was stated he sounded very direspecting of the situation but then he seemed confused why family was so upset
88,0,5d482ea721c9be351f76308a,delightedBison,2020-04-29T00:10:07.809Z,The writer  comes off as passive aggressive which rings an alarm. He does have a right to be annoyed I think anyone would be.
88,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761f3c,livelyDolphin,2020-04-29T00:10:55.815Z,"yeah, I agree with the passive agressiveness"
88,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762d97,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-29T00:10:56.025Z,They too were disrespectful for relying on him to interpret all the time.  
88,0,5d482ea321c9be351f761f92,curiousBear,2020-04-29T00:11:04.148Z,"I agree his feelings are valid, but she is also old and elderly often rely on the kids and if shed been relying on others so long perhaps a better approach would have been to work with family to help her learn"
88,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762d97,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-29T00:11:52.969Z,"Because she is old and elderly does not give her the right to ""expect"" him to always be the interpreter."
88,0,5d482ea321c9be351f761f92,curiousBear,2020-04-29T00:12:22.070Z,"but if shed been helped without resistance for years, him ""popping off"" as the kids say is uncalled for"
88,0,5d482ea321c9be351f7620b3,inquisitiveOtter,2020-04-29T00:12:28.548Z,"If the other children were able to interpret, they should have. I do think he has a right to be frustrated, but I get the impression he took it out on the MIL and handled it poorly. His beef should have been with her other children."
88,0,5d482ea321c9be351f761f92,curiousBear,2020-04-29T00:12:29.651Z,he held no tact in the situation
88,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762d97,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-29T00:13:14.776Z,The family has valid reasons to be upset but still I do not believe they are in the right to expect him to not be upset. He could have used a different way to express.
88,0,5d482ea321c9be351f7620b3,inquisitiveOtter,2020-04-29T00:13:35.725Z,"Assuming that she should be able to do it because he was able to do it makes me feel like he lacks empathy and understanding in the situation, as well."
88,0,5d482ea721c9be351f76308a,delightedBison,2020-04-29T00:13:51.872Z,No it doesn't give her the right. But it doesn't give him a right to be rude either. If he can't handle it he should talk it out with his wife to make arrangements where she doesn't call him as much.
88,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761f3c,livelyDolphin,2020-04-29T00:13:55.869Z,I think that overall the author could definitely be more tactful. You don't get constructive conversation and change from 'popping off' as one of the previous posters put it
88,0,5d482ea721c9be351f76308a,delightedBison,2020-04-29T00:14:18.975Z,I agree the Auther could be more tactful.
88,0,5d482ea321c9be351f761f92,curiousBear,2020-04-29T00:14:21.070Z,"In my perspective, all feelings are totally valid in the situation, but the follow through was absolutely wrong in its approach"
88,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761f3c,livelyDolphin,2020-04-29T00:14:27.184Z,I'd say that the author is 'an asshole' due to his handling of the situation. 
88,0,5d482ea321c9be351f761f92,curiousBear,2020-04-29T00:14:32.829Z,agree 
88,0,5d482ea721c9be351f76308a,delightedBison,2020-04-29T00:14:56.945Z,agree
88,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762d97,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-29T00:15:02.577Z,He was not tactful in how he choose to deal with the situation but he has very valid reasons and I believe his reasons are accurate.
88,1,5d482ea321c9be351f761f92,excitedBison,2020-04-29T00:23:36.012Z,Im a little in between on this one but ultimate;y think she was a bit dramatic
88,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f3c,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-29T00:23:54.166Z,"So, I'm thinking that she is the asshole here too. Seems to me like she isn't taking her husbands concerns seriously and is avoiding the work to help her family"
88,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762d97,curiousGorilla,2020-04-29T00:24:00.181Z,My thought is she should have equally been taking the calls instead of passing them on and choosing that she is more busy than he is
88,1,5d482ea321c9be351f761f92,excitedBison,2020-04-29T00:24:02.777Z,granted the husbands initial action may have ticked her off too
88,1,5d482ea321c9be351f7620b3,inspiredElephant,2020-04-29T00:24:08.265Z,Seeing the other side of this situation makes it seem that she didn't show any appreciation to the husband for doing this for so long.
88,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f3c,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-29T00:24:12.159Z,Yeah
88,1,5d482ea321c9be351f761f92,excitedBison,2020-04-29T00:24:15.516Z,yeah
88,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f3c,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-29T00:24:39.046Z,I think that she hsould be helping - and having 'more time' is a dangerous perception for your significant other to have
88,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762d97,curiousGorilla,2020-04-29T00:24:41.413Z,The husband pretty much tried but she was being the selfish one so I'd say she is the asshole
88,1,5d482ea321c9be351f761f92,excitedBison,2020-04-29T00:24:48.982Z,"I think she was less dramatic about it, just like ""annoyed at my hubs"" vibe, but that she is also in the wrong here too"
88,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76308a,lightGiraffe,2020-04-29T00:25:01.559Z,I see the writer side and his side. It makes also feel in between. She was dramatizing it. Her husband did come off a little angry which could cause her reaction.
88,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f3c,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-29T00:25:18.416Z,"seemed like it was a small deal for her, but a large one for her spouse. And then she doesn't understand how it's a big deal to him"
88,1,5d482ea321c9be351f761f92,excitedBison,2020-04-29T00:25:23.425Z,and trying to say that her parents have done enough and dont have to learn is simply ignorant
88,1,5d482ea321c9be351f7620b3,inspiredElephant,2020-04-29T00:25:29.865Z,They both seem defensive instead of communicating.
88,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762d97,curiousGorilla,2020-04-29T00:25:37.302Z,There would probably not have been a problem if both shared the responsibility equally but she pushed it on him
88,1,5d482ea321c9be351f761f92,excitedBison,2020-04-29T00:25:38.310Z,EXACTLY 
88,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76308a,lightGiraffe,2020-04-29T00:25:49.504Z,They both seemed defensive to me to.
88,1,5d482ea321c9be351f761f92,excitedBison,2020-04-29T00:26:00.650Z,on the need to communicate better notion i mean
88,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762d97,curiousGorilla,2020-04-29T00:26:18.793Z,The family should also try harder to learn the language of the country they are living in.
88,1,5d482ea721c9be351f76308a,lightGiraffe,2020-04-29T00:26:33.568Z,I believe they both needed better communiction on the subject.
88,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f3c,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-29T00:26:36.222Z,"I mean, I don't think there is anyone completely in the right - all are at least somewhat wrong"
88,1,5d482ea321c9be351f7620b3,inspiredElephant,2020-04-29T00:26:49.307Z,"I think she is the asshole in the situation as well. Not for being defensive of her parents, but for not being open to her husband about his concerns."
88,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f3c,fulfilledHorse,2020-04-29T00:27:03.729Z,^ agreed
88,1,5d482ea321c9be351f761f92,excitedBison,2020-04-29T00:27:04.895Z,"yeah, even if there is no ""official"" language of the land they should know how to communicate with the most used language"
88,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762d97,curiousGorilla,2020-04-29T00:27:13.823Z,Communication is important but I still don't believe the wife was listening to the husbands side at all

90,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761f7d,fulfilledCamel,2020-04-29T01:42:33.123Z,I think the protagonist is the asshole for choosing his husband over the mother instead of making an effort to include both.
90,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761ec9,livelyMonkey,2020-04-29T01:42:40.338Z,"I have to agree, She is an asshole because her mother wanted to have them visit and wanted to feel included. "

Her mother is hosting her and feeding them and she won't even speak a language she can understand even though her husband can speak it but is just embarrassed by some mistakes
91,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761e9a,livelyCamel,2020-04-29T01:27:11.596Z,I know if I told anyone I know that I did that to my mother they would call me an asshole 100% and I wouldnt blame them.

91,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f64,livelyHorse,2020-04-29T01:44:27.326Z,i've considered both sides and if the parnter was that upset it's clear to me the mother was at fault

91,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e9a,eagerZebra,2020-04-29T01:45:44.681Z,its weird that people are OK with staying in someone elses house not to mention their own mother and speak a language she doesn't understand when hanging out with her

The wife has a right to ask her husband to help her family out.      It's a place where they have to compromise"
93,2,5d482ea521c9be351f762444,livelyCamel,2020-04-29T17:48:34.259Z,"That's true, inquisitiveHippo .  Now we just have to pick yes or no - haha!"
93,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7624a8,novelZebra,2020-04-29T17:48:45.309Z,well the question is is she the asshole?
93,2,5d482ea721c9be351f763067,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-29T17:48:46.703Z,I'd say she is the asshole. She has the right to ask her husband to help out. But she isn't clear that she asked him.
93,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762936,inquisitiveHippo,2020-04-29T17:48:56.025Z,I'm going to say No.   This is a situation where there is no asshole.

93,2,5d482ea721c9be351f763067,fulfilledDolphin,2020-04-29T17:49:24.892Z,I could accept a weak no. Rude but not an ass
93,2,5d482ea521c9be351f762444,livelyCamel,2020-04-29T17:49:36.010Z,Sounds good.
93,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762936,inquisitiveHippo,2020-04-29T17:49:39.060Z,Sometimes both people can be right but still disagree.

93,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763067,brightBear,2020-04-29T18:00:35.828Z,Hello!
93,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762936,eagerBison,2020-04-29T18:00:40.686Z,Hello.  
93,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f5e,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-29T18:00:46.054Z,I'd like to say that the writer is an unreliable narrator from the conflicting information presented. The attitude they demonstrate doesn't seem to agree with the facts they present
93,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762444,delightedMonkey,2020-04-29T18:00:55.281Z,I am inclined to say that this was hugely out of line!  He knew what he was getting into when he married into this family.
93,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763067,brightBear,2020-04-29T18:00:57.339Z,I am considering the difference between what he said and how he said it.
93,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f5e,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-29T18:01:02.575Z,yes
93,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7624a8,curiousHorse,2020-04-29T18:01:23.223Z,It is true the tone in the narrative is contradicting.
93,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762444,delightedMonkey,2020-04-29T18:01:30.157Z,Good point.
93,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763067,brightBear,2020-04-29T18:01:40.165Z,I don't think there is anything wrong with not wanting to translate. But his reasoning (and then his correction) feel off.
93,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762936,eagerBison,2020-04-29T18:01:45.408Z,"Oddly,  the words he said he used are aproperiate and good,  but his general tone is not.  "
93,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762444,delightedMonkey,2020-04-29T18:02:01.774Z,I imagine he was less than courteous when actually speaking and lightened up for the retelling of the story.
93,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763067,brightBear,2020-04-29T18:02:14.216Z,Agreed delightedMonkey
93,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7624a8,curiousHorse,2020-04-29T18:02:17.970Z,he is right about people should try to find the way to be independant for their own sake... however not everyone has the same language learning skills
93,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f5e,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-29T18:02:29.504Z,is there anyone that doesn't feel he was the asshole?
93,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7624a8,curiousHorse,2020-04-29T18:02:32.607Z,specially older people
93,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763067,brightBear,2020-04-29T18:02:45.170Z,I am leaning toward asshole.
93,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762936,eagerBison,2020-04-29T18:02:47.959Z,"I was on the fence,  but I'd say that he was a little assholish.   "
93,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762444,delightedMonkey,2020-04-29T18:02:52.526Z,I'm thinking asshole.
93,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f5e,inquisitiveCamel,2020-04-29T18:03:04.641Z,sounds good to me
93,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7624a8,curiousHorse,2020-04-29T18:03:17.242Z,"I thinnk he is right, however he acts like an ass about it"
93,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762936,eagerBison,2020-04-29T18:03:58.796Z,"It also sounds like the mother in law has this sort of self-reinforcing community.   People who learn languages fast do so through total immersion,   basically having no choice but to speak the new language 24/7. "
93,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762936,eagerBison,2020-04-29T18:04:13.116Z,"WIth a large spanish speaking family,  the MIL isn't capable of achieving that.   "
93,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763067,brightBear,2020-04-29T18:05:08.019Z,"I don't know if you can tell someone they have to learn a language. You can refuse to translate, but I don't think you can dictate what they do."
93,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762936,eagerBison,2020-04-29T18:05:25.654Z,"No,   you can't force anyone to learn anything.  "
93,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762936,eagerBison,2020-04-29T18:05:33.611Z,Though you can encourage them.   
93,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763067,brightBear,2020-04-29T18:05:42.265Z,He didn't sound encouraging
93,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762936,eagerBison,2020-04-29T18:05:52.211Z,"If he was supportive  that would be one thing,  yes.   But he was demanding,  instead.  "
94,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762f65,eagerZebra,2020-04-29T17:03:06.775Z,Hello everyone. I believe that this person was the asshole in this situation.
94,1,5e31d78fe31c5304c46f18ac,excitedMonkey,2020-04-29T17:03:07.123Z,My initial response was that she was being kind of an asshole. What does everyone else think?
94,1,5ea9a7c8a68ffa2bcbe11876,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-29T17:03:16.517Z,"Honestly, it's rude to speak in a foreign language in front of other people if they can't understand it. Especially if they have the capacity to speak the language she does."
94,1,5ea0c63a9dc0406f89889495,openBear,2020-04-29T17:03:23.679Z,This person was the asshole
94,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763dd9,brightOtter,2020-04-29T17:03:37.377Z,"me too think she was an asshole, coz she was interfering with their talk"
94,1,5ea9a7c8a68ffa2bcbe11876,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-29T17:03:40.788Z,"I am bilingual and I wouldn't speak like that, but yeah she was a bit of an asshole I'm not gonna sway people saying she's not. "
94,1,5ea75e96fd339b022f9ceba8,lightHippo,2020-04-29T17:03:45.252Z,I feel that it is disrespectful to speak French when capable of speaking English when the mother is in the room. 
94,1,5ea9a7aaa68ffa2bcbe11875,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-29T17:03:45.338Z,"Yes, she's definitely an asshole. While it's not rude to speak in a foreign language in front of others, it should be avoided if possible."
94,1,5e31d78fe31c5304c46f18ac,excitedMonkey,2020-04-29T17:03:57.771Z,I think she was being an asshole because he may not speak as much as she thinks.
94,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762f65,eagerZebra,2020-04-29T17:04:16.171Z,She could have just asked to know what they were talking about.
94,1,5ea9a7aaa68ffa2bcbe11875,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-29T17:04:22.893Z,"Instead of telling them that they're disrespectful, she could have simply asked, ""what did you say?"""
94,1,5ea9a7c8a68ffa2bcbe11876,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-29T17:04:24.591Z,"They were in her house though, and in front of her. But yeah, excitedMonkey is correct maybe he doesn't speak it that well."
94,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763dd9,brightOtter,2020-04-29T17:04:36.573Z,"exactly,she could have asked them"
94,1,5e31d78fe31c5304c46f18ac,excitedMonkey,2020-04-29T17:04:41.977Z,"Also, the conversation may not have needed to include her. You can have your own conversations while with other people."
94,1,5ea0c63a9dc0406f89889495,openBear,2020-04-29T17:04:47.040Z,It was difficult to decide just a little. It says he can speak english but what if its very little. So he feels more comfortable speaking french.
94,1,5ea9a7c8a68ffa2bcbe11876,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-29T17:04:55.601Z,"Agreed, I'll move over to the asshole side as those are good arguments."
94,1,5ea9a7aaa68ffa2bcbe11875,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-29T17:05:12.817Z,Definitely the asshole.
94,1,5e31d78fe31c5304c46f18ac,excitedMonkey,2020-04-29T17:05:25.265Z,He's only 20 and I can see why he'd be upset.
94,1,5ea0c63a9dc0406f89889495,openBear,2020-04-29T17:05:28.495Z,She honestly could have let them just talk and went a did something else like make a meal or something.
94,1,5ea9a7c8a68ffa2bcbe11876,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-29T17:05:54.867Z,"In her defense though. I speak English and Spanish...if I was at someone's house that spoke English only I wouldn't speak Spanish in front of them. But again, his English might not be that good"
94,1,5ea9a7aaa68ffa2bcbe11875,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-29T17:05:58.155Z,"On the other hand, her son should have translated the conversation."
94,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762f65,eagerZebra,2020-04-29T17:06:21.850Z,I can understand where she's coming from a little bit
94,1,5ea9a7aaa68ffa2bcbe11875,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-29T17:06:23.904Z,"it doesn't have to be word for word, just a general translation"
94,1,5ea9a7aaa68ffa2bcbe11875,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-29T17:06:40.414Z,"""we're just talking about what we're going to do tomorrow"" or something like that"
94,1,5ea9a7aaa68ffa2bcbe11875,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-29T17:06:50.868Z,that would be courteous...
94,1,5ea9a7c8a68ffa2bcbe11876,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-29T17:06:53.575Z,"Yeah, both sides could have made this go better honestly."
94,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763dd9,brightOtter,2020-04-29T17:07:03.158Z,"im looking to see if i can support the son, but dont see a strong enough reason to support."
94,1,5e31d78fe31c5304c46f18ac,excitedMonkey,2020-04-29T17:07:05.200Z,"I understand where she's coming from it's uncomfortable. But, she could have asked instead of being rude."
94,1,5ea9a7c8a68ffa2bcbe11876,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-29T17:07:30.892Z,"Was she rude though? Her verbiage could have been better for sure, but eh she came off as annoyed if anything."
94,1,5ea0c63a9dc0406f89889495,openBear,2020-04-29T17:07:40.045Z,"She was the asshole for being rude but in a nice way. She was aware that he could speak english but now how well though. Also, just because someone has a convo in another language in front of you doesnt mean they are talking about you."
94,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762f65,eagerZebra,2020-04-29T17:07:55.529Z,"Even if she was annoyed, what she did wasn't the way to handle it"
94,1,5ea9a7aaa68ffa2bcbe11875,fulfilledGorilla,2020-04-29T17:08:00.580Z,exactly.
94,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763dd9,brightOtter,2020-04-29T17:08:10.276Z,"she is the asshole, for being rude to a person who is younger than her son, she could be anti gay too"
94,1,5ea0c63a9dc0406f89889495,openBear,2020-04-29T17:08:26.947Z,I do feel where she comes from although. She felt disrespected because they stopped talking in english and now she cannot understand.
94,1,5ea9a7c8a68ffa2bcbe11876,inspiredGiraffe,2020-04-29T17:08:30.616Z,"Honestly, I'm leaning towards NTA sorry guys,. "
94,1,5ea0c63a9dc0406f89889495,openBear,2020-04-29T17:08:51.594Z,I feel she is the asshole. She assumed and was wrong.
94,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762f65,eagerZebra,2020-04-29T17:08:54.253Z,I still think she's the asshole

94,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f65,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-29T17:17:31.846Z,I don't think he was being an asshole 
94,2,5ea0c63a9dc0406f89889495,openMonkey,2020-04-29T17:17:34.917Z,I feel like she is not the asshole in this case
94,2,5ea0c63a9dc0406f89889495,openMonkey,2020-04-29T17:17:41.261Z,I meant he
94,2,5e31d78fe31c5304c46f18ac,curiousOtter,2020-04-29T17:17:58.603Z,I think he was being an asshole because it seemed like he was deliberately not including his mother.
94,2,5ea9a7c8a68ffa2bcbe11876,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T17:18:11.989Z,Yeah I  agree
94,2,5ea0c63a9dc0406f89889495,openMonkey,2020-04-29T17:18:19.728Z,I did get that vibe 
94,2,5ea9a7aaa68ffa2bcbe11875,eagerGorilla,2020-04-29T17:18:26.399Z,"She's definitely not the asshole. If he wants to speak German with his husband, that's fine, but he should translate when necessary (which means probably most of the time)."
94,2,5e31d78fe31c5304c46f18ac,curiousOtter,2020-04-29T17:18:33.672Z,"If it was a private conversation sure he can speak what he wants, but he said he spoke German the whole time."
94,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f65,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-29T17:18:36.286Z,I don't think he should have exclusively chose to speak german but i don't think he did it to exlcude the mom
94,2,5ea9a7c8a68ffa2bcbe11876,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T17:18:38.871Z,Plus they live far away for half the year. 
94,2,5e31d78fe31c5304c46f18ac,curiousOtter,2020-04-29T17:18:42.800Z,I can see why she is mad.
94,2,5ea9a7aaa68ffa2bcbe11875,eagerGorilla,2020-04-29T17:18:57.425Z,"His mom probably isn't going to learn much German, but his husband will probably learn more English and is younger...it's a ""respect for elders"" kinda thing too"

94,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763dd9,excitedZebra,2020-04-29T17:19:27.177Z,the mom should not interfere in the couple's conversation
94,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763dd9,excitedZebra,2020-04-29T17:19:43.084Z,she needs to give them some space
94,2,5e31d78fe31c5304c46f18ac,curiousOtter,2020-04-29T17:19:47.194Z,"The son could have tried translating what his husband meant, and go back and forth."
94,2,5ea9a7c8a68ffa2bcbe11876,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T17:19:48.944Z,Then why even stay at the mom's house if you're not going to converse with her? 
94,2,5ea9a7c8a68ffa2bcbe11876,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T17:19:53.579Z,Go to a hotel.
94,2,5e31d78fe31c5304c46f18ac,curiousOtter,2020-04-29T17:20:34.104Z,I only think he was being an asshole for exclusively speaking German and ignoring his mother. Al least that's what it sounded like.
94,2,5ea0c63a9dc0406f89889495,openMonkey,2020-04-29T17:20:36.576Z,I do feel the mothers side also. I would feel left out to as well when they started speaking german.
94,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763dd9,excitedZebra,2020-04-29T17:20:37.512Z,the mom shouldnt interfere much in their conversations

94,2,5ea9a7aaa68ffa2bcbe11875,eagerGorilla,2020-04-29T17:20:56.706Z,"He also needs to talk to his husband and explain that he doesn't have to be uncomfy speaking English around his mom--it's a good way to practice, and surely she wouldn't make fun of him"
94,2,5ea0c63a9dc0406f89889495,openMonkey,2020-04-29T17:21:36.582Z,Communication is key in this situation. Its seems though that the mom just wanted to be nosey so thats why she think he is the asshole.
94,2,5ea75e96fd339b022f9ceba8,brightElephant,2020-04-29T17:21:38.963Z,Agreed eagerGorilla
94,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763dd9,excitedZebra,2020-04-29T17:21:44.428Z,the mom doesnt have the right to control which language her daughter speaks.
94,2,5ea9a7c8a68ffa2bcbe11876,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T17:21:47.918Z,"The son is definitely the asshole in my opinion, and shouldn't have even bothered going to moms house if this was the stance he was going to take. Imo"
94,2,5e31d78fe31c5304c46f18ac,curiousOtter,2020-04-29T17:22:02.889Z,Exactly they need the awkward communication start to build the husbands and mothers relationship.
94,2,5e31d78fe31c5304c46f18ac,curiousOtter,2020-04-29T17:22:14.489Z,"Yeah, the son is the asshole."
94,2,5ea0c63a9dc0406f89889495,openMonkey,2020-04-29T17:22:23.065Z,It does say tho he spoke german most of the time but not all the time.
94,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763dd9,excitedZebra,2020-04-29T17:22:33.445Z,exactly
94,2,5ea9a7c8a68ffa2bcbe11876,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T17:22:44.045Z,Seems like this is gonna be a split vote
94,2,5ea0c63a9dc0406f89889495,openMonkey,2020-04-29T17:22:52.752Z,I think it was balanced out to me. Maybe mom just wanted to know a little bit to much and got offended.
94,2,5e31d78fe31c5304c46f18ac,curiousOtter,2020-04-29T17:22:58.126Z,Very split.
94,2,5ea9a7aaa68ffa2bcbe11875,eagerGorilla,2020-04-29T17:23:02.650Z,that's a possibility
94,2,5ea9a7aaa68ffa2bcbe11875,eagerGorilla,2020-04-29T17:23:15.159Z,"but my guess is that the son spoke more German than he really ""needed"" to"
94,2,5ea0c63a9dc0406f89889495,openMonkey,2020-04-29T17:23:30.761Z,Could be so....
94,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762f65,delightedGiraffe,2020-04-29T17:23:38.518Z,I don't think he was purposefully ignoring the mom.
94,2,5ea9a7c8a68ffa2bcbe11876,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T17:23:43.233Z,"Yeah I'm thinking that way too, but maybe it was more 50/50 it's hard to say"
94,2,5ea0c63a9dc0406f89889495,openMonkey,2020-04-29T17:23:43.895Z,I am going with him not being the asshole
95,1,5ea9ad9aa68ffa2bcbe11b29,lightGorilla,2020-04-29T19:45:19.773Z,I believe that the American woman should know to carry a conversation without anyone feeling left out.
95,1,5ea9a890a68ffa2bcbe1187c,brightDolphin,2020-04-29T19:45:41.989Z,The mother is an asshole for attacking her son before asking why they chose to speak another language.
95,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763937,eagerOtter,2020-04-29T19:45:43.994Z,"The OP is in their family's house with other people who all speak English and is speaking German to not let one person, who apparently sort of speaks English, feel left out. The needs of the many"
95,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764140,openHorse,2020-04-29T19:45:58.817Z,After considering both sides I would say that the guy isn't an asshole because his intentions  were to make his partner feel comfortable not leave out his mother
95,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f87,livelyMonkey,2020-04-29T19:46:15.968Z,"I think that since his husband knew how to speak English, and they were visiting the mother, they should have not left the mother out of the conversation"
95,1,5ea9ad9aa68ffa2bcbe11b29,lightGorilla,2020-04-29T19:46:29.461Z,I agree
95,1,5ea8c98e7d50722703c58e0e,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T19:46:30.767Z,I think the person is the asshole because the husband does understand English and can speak it (even if it's broken.) 
95,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f87,livelyMonkey,2020-04-29T19:46:38.145Z,Both men knew how to speak English
95,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f87,livelyMonkey,2020-04-29T19:46:41.789Z,"Yes, I think the same."
95,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763937,eagerOtter,2020-04-29T19:46:43.241Z,"But is leaving out everyone else. They don't even mention trying to translate one way or another, just speaking mostly German"
95,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764140,openHorse,2020-04-29T19:46:43.809Z,true
95,1,5ea9ad9aa68ffa2bcbe11b29,lightGorilla,2020-04-29T19:47:01.893Z,"True, the German guy needs to grow up and try even though it's not comfortable."
95,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f87,livelyMonkey,2020-04-29T19:47:13.221Z,Agreed lightGorilla
95,1,5ea9ad9aa68ffa2bcbe11b29,lightGorilla,2020-04-29T19:47:18.913Z,"Come on, both of you guys are a married "
95,1,5ea8c98e7d50722703c58e0e,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T19:47:21.224Z," have been in the same situation having a father that does not speak my mother's language, but I still speak my mother's language when I visit her family."
95,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f87,livelyMonkey,2020-04-29T19:47:41.537Z,I think it's a good sign of respect and caring
95,1,5ea9a890a68ffa2bcbe1187c,brightDolphin,2020-04-29T19:47:54.488Z,Calling your son an asshole for that is a bit extreme though.
95,1,5ea8c98e7d50722703c58e0e,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T19:48:00.910Z,It's disrespectful to leave the person that is feeding you and housing you out of the conversation.
95,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764140,openHorse,2020-04-29T19:48:05.399Z,"I agree and they are at his mothers house, he should at least try"
95,1,5ea8c98e7d50722703c58e0e,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T19:48:14.920Z,Exactly. He should try.
95,1,5ea8c98e7d50722703c58e0e,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T19:48:47.415Z,The mother would be greatful that he is trying even if he gets words wrong.
95,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763937,eagerOtter,2020-04-29T19:49:02.219Z,"If the German person were trying and asking for the OP to translate here and there, or asking a small question in German, that's one thing but not even trying to speak English and just letting the OP sit and speak German is rude"
95,1,5ea8c98e7d50722703c58e0e,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T19:49:15.262Z,I agree with eagerOtter on that too
95,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764140,openHorse,2020-04-29T19:49:18.856Z,same
95,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764140,openHorse,2020-04-29T19:49:30.721Z,It works both ways
95,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764140,openHorse,2020-04-29T19:49:44.557Z,But him not trying is rude 
95,1,5ea8c98e7d50722703c58e0e,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T19:49:54.937Z,it is very rude
95,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763937,eagerOtter,2020-04-29T19:49:57.375Z,"Agreed. If the OP had tried to bridge the gap or encouraged the partner too, wouldn't be an issue"
95,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f87,livelyMonkey,2020-04-29T19:50:03.628Z,"Either way, at the end of the day, I think the OP is wrong here. Do we have consensus on that as a group?"
95,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763937,eagerOtter,2020-04-29T19:50:04.840Z,to
95,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763379,excitedBison,2020-04-29T19:50:10.015Z,"I think its tough to call, but I do think it was a little rude. He could have tried"
95,1,5ea8c98e7d50722703c58e0e,inspiredCamel,2020-04-29T19:51:01.776Z,I think it was super rude to talk in German the entire time.
95,1,5ea9a890a68ffa2bcbe1187c,brightDolphin,2020-04-29T19:51:24.926Z,I don't think it was that serious. He tried to please everyone but it came off wrong.
95,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763379,excitedBison,2020-04-29T19:51:28.715Z,If I was his mother I would feel left out
95,3,5ea9a890a68ffa2bcbe1187c,inquisitiveOtter,2020-04-29T20:14:58.181Z,I think the two boys are inconsiderate.
95,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764140,eagerDolphin,2020-04-29T20:15:01.833Z,I agree
95,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764140,eagerDolphin,2020-04-29T20:15:12.416Z,Since the partner can speak English he should
95,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763937,novelGiraffe,2020-04-29T20:15:30.825Z,"Agreed. Also, if the OP said that, they could have discussed it with her instead of one basically storming off."
95,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763937,novelGiraffe,2020-04-29T20:15:32.365Z,Rude.
95,3,5ea8c98e7d50722703c58e0e,lightBear,2020-04-29T20:15:36.610Z,"The mom is not an asshole because they are being inconsiderate, especially when they both can speak english"
95,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f87,brightHorse,2020-04-29T20:15:53.858Z,I agree with all of the above statements. 
95,3,5ea9ad9aa68ffa2bcbe11b29,inspiredHippo,2020-04-29T20:16:00.858Z,The partner should be considerate that the mother does not know French. 
95,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764140,eagerDolphin,2020-04-29T20:16:02.308Z,They are staying at the mom's house too so they should consider her as well
95,3,5ea8c98e7d50722703c58e0e,lightBear,2020-04-29T20:16:10.237Z,"however, the mom could have mentioned it privately to her son instead of in front of both the partner and her son."
95,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f87,brightHorse,2020-04-29T20:16:12.045Z,"Especially because they were visiting the mother, indicating they do not see her very often."
95,3,5ea9a890a68ffa2bcbe1187c,inquisitiveOtter,2020-04-29T20:16:20.053Z,He had nothing even hold him back emotionally or medically from speaking English. The behavior was odd.
95,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764140,eagerDolphin,2020-04-29T20:16:22.204Z,"Yeah for the partner to go upstairs, he made that awkward"
95,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764140,eagerDolphin,2020-04-29T20:16:43.659Z,not the mom
95,3,5ea9a890a68ffa2bcbe1187c,inquisitiveOtter,2020-04-29T20:16:44.958Z,The mother could've mentioned it privately but it's her house.
95,3,5ea9ad9aa68ffa2bcbe11b29,inspiredHippo,2020-04-29T20:16:49.055Z,This is very similar to previous situations
95,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763937,novelGiraffe,2020-04-29T20:16:54.693Z,"Given the son's reaction, I doubt it'd hve gone over better if she just talked to the son alone"
95,3,5ea8c98e7d50722703c58e0e,lightBear,2020-04-29T20:17:13.921Z,"yes, it is her house, which is why i don't think she is the asshole. just could have handled the situation differently"
95,3,5ea9a890a68ffa2bcbe1187c,inquisitiveOtter,2020-04-29T20:17:16.190Z,"If she wants to address the guest in her home, she's allowed to."
95,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763937,novelGiraffe,2020-04-29T20:17:36.570Z,"besides, it's not like it's some personal thing or issue she had with the partner. She legit seemed to want both of them to understand their behaviour felt excluding."
95,3,5ea9ad9aa68ffa2bcbe11b29,inspiredHippo,2020-04-29T20:17:38.114Z,She did say it nicely to them
95,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764140,eagerDolphin,2020-04-29T20:17:38.471Z,I don't think she's the asshole in the situation either
95,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764140,eagerDolphin,2020-04-29T20:18:01.715Z,Exactly it was the exclusion part that bothered her
95,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f87,brightHorse,2020-04-29T20:18:06.604Z,Neither do I. There's nothing wrong with wanting to be included in the conversation.
95,3,5ea8c98e7d50722703c58e0e,lightBear,2020-04-29T20:18:06.630Z,novelGiraffe good point
95,3,5ea9a890a68ffa2bcbe1187c,inquisitiveOtter,2020-04-29T20:18:35.478Z,She didn't even attack anyone verbally and she was inclusive in telling them both instead of pulling her son aside I'd say. Something they were not.
95,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763937,novelGiraffe,2020-04-29T20:19:34.642Z,"Exactly inquisitiveOtter -- if it was like 'your partner is doing X and I'd like you to ask them to please stop blowing their nose on the good tablecloth' ok, speak to your son alone."
95,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764140,eagerDolphin,2020-04-29T20:19:39.930Z,Yeah and talking in another language like that makes you think maybe their are talking about you or don't want you to hear...either way doesn't feel good
95,3,5ea8c98e7d50722703c58e0e,lightBear,2020-04-29T20:19:59.694Z,i agree eagerDolphin
95,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764140,eagerDolphin,2020-04-29T20:20:00.657Z,they're
95,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763937,novelGiraffe,2020-04-29T20:20:02.999Z,But this is both of them doing it and it's not something one doesn't speak of in polite society or something
96,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76286e,excitedCamel,2020-05-01T01:44:15.716Z,She should've just kept asking them to translate what they were saying.
96,1,5eab5e9cd5ea945196f999fa,livelyBison,2020-05-01T01:44:48.876Z,"Hi! Yeah I agree, or should've just tried to start conversation in English."
96,1,5eab7490d5ea945196f9cac7,curiousMonkey,2020-05-01T01:45:12.612Z,"I believe that if she invited them to stay in her home, they could have made an effort to speak English to include her. Or she could have asked to speak in English instead to stating that it's disrespectful because she did make it awkward."
96,1,5eab7454d5ea945196f9c9ef,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T01:45:19.073Z,"It was plain rude, when I lived in Germany you spoke German unless of course they wanted your cash then they spoke english"
96,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76286e,excitedCamel,2020-05-01T01:45:24.285Z,Maybe the guy just felt more comfortable to speak in his native language.
96,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762e26,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T01:45:33.344Z,The mother should try speaking in English and maybe they'll follow. 
96,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76286e,excitedCamel,2020-05-01T01:46:05.368Z,Many ways about it rather than scolding them on being disrespectful.  Silly & rude even though it was her house.
96,1,5eab7454d5ea945196f9c9ef,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T01:46:29.319Z,Her son could of translated everything too. But the Husband spoke English
96,1,5eab7490d5ea945196f9cac7,curiousMonkey,2020-05-01T01:46:47.990Z,"She stated that she believed it was disrespectful, and if she asked ""would you mind speaking in English so I can be a part of the conversation?"" maybe things wouldn't have gone the way they did."
96,1,5eab5e9cd5ea945196f999fa,livelyBison,2020-05-01T01:47:03.684Z,"Yeah, or maybe emphasize that she didn't like being left out while being in the same room, rather than making it about the language difference."
96,1,5eab7490d5ea945196f9cac7,curiousMonkey,2020-05-01T01:47:18.763Z,"Yes! If her son translated, that would be a way for his native husband to continue speaking French."
96,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762e26,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T01:47:30.402Z,I agree. A nicer approach of telling them she wants to converse with them as well would have been better
96,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76286e,excitedCamel,2020-05-01T01:47:46.471Z,"Very true.  Plus, depending on how strong his accent was, she may have trouble understanding him anyways."
96,1,5eab5e9cd5ea945196f999fa,livelyBison,2020-05-01T01:47:49.550Z,"True, unless they were talking about something private, in which case that would be kind of rude to do with someone in the same room"
96,1,5eab7454d5ea945196f9c9ef,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T01:47:56.104Z,"with that said, they are grown men and I say the husband did it on purpose to get at the MIL"
96,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76286e,excitedCamel,2020-05-01T01:48:11.019Z,Grown man of 20.
96,1,5eab7490d5ea945196f9cac7,curiousMonkey,2020-05-01T01:48:35.116Z,"I think that if she isn't fluent in French, her son and his husband also could have helped her learn a few phrases as well. She should make an effort herself to begin to learn the language, too for their sake."
96,1,5eab7454d5ea945196f9c9ef,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T01:48:38.837Z,"Coming from immigrants, my Great Grandmother would not let the native tongue be spoken unless all in the room could speak it."
96,1,5eab7454d5ea945196f9c9ef,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T01:49:31.577Z,I don't think that the mom was an asshole 
96,1,5eab5e9cd5ea945196f999fa,livelyBison,2020-05-01T01:49:50.268Z,"I think she was maybe wrong in the way she went about expressing it, but yeah I think she was just feeling left out and uncomfortable."
96,1,5eab7490d5ea945196f9cac7,curiousMonkey,2020-05-01T01:50:17.838Z,They should respect the language spoken in her house since she invited them to stay for a week.
96,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762e26,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T01:50:30.629Z,It's understandable to be felt left out if all they spoke was French
96,3,5eab5e9cd5ea945196f999fa,fulfilledHippo,2020-05-01T02:14:14.190Z,"I don't think this person was being an asshole, more just kind of stuck in an uncomfortable position."
96,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76286e,lightGiraffe,2020-05-01T02:14:22.030Z,I think he should've been translating for his mom so she could be part of the conversation.
96,3,5eab7454d5ea945196f9c9ef,openMonkey,2020-05-01T02:14:44.793Z,I think that since mom was nice enough to host them they should be speaking English for the most part and if the the husband get stuck he could ask the son how to translate what he wanted to convey
96,3,5eab5e9cd5ea945196f999fa,fulfilledHippo,2020-05-01T02:14:47.702Z,"Yeah I understand why the mother would be upset too, it would have helped for him to translate"
96,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76286e,lightGiraffe,2020-05-01T02:14:48.903Z,I agree.  It was just awkward.  The hubs should've tried a bit harder.
96,3,5eab7490d5ea945196f9cac7,delightedOtter,2020-05-01T02:14:53.675Z,"I believe that since the mother invited her son and his partner, they should make sure she is somehow included in the conversation. Either by translation or by English."
96,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e26,brightElephant,2020-05-01T02:15:18.076Z,It's only for the weekend and he hasn't seen his mother for a while. They should have tried to speak English or the husband should have translated
96,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76286e,lightGiraffe,2020-05-01T02:15:27.671Z,A lot of selfishness the whole way around but no real a$$holes.
96,3,5eab7490d5ea945196f9cac7,delightedOtter,2020-05-01T02:15:33.575Z,"I think she should make sure that her son's husband feels welcome and that he shouldn't be embarrassed if he messes up while speaking English. They're family, they shouldn't care"
96,3,5eab5e9cd5ea945196f999fa,fulfilledHippo,2020-05-01T02:16:33.727Z,"I can also imagine that in the flow of a conversation, he might just not have thought to stop and translate every single back and forth."
96,3,5eab7454d5ea945196f9c9ef,openMonkey,2020-05-01T02:16:33.794Z,"I have never know any German to be shy about how they speak, not to mention any German born after WWII were taught English throughout shcool"
96,3,5eab7490d5ea945196f9cac7,delightedOtter,2020-05-01T02:16:51.580Z,"English is a difficult language to learn, but if English is the language spoken at his mother's house, it should be the language spoken by all out of respect"
96,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76286e,lightGiraffe,2020-05-01T02:17:13.331Z,Especially since they live in the US part-time.
96,3,5eab7454d5ea945196f9c9ef,openMonkey,2020-05-01T02:18:04.824Z,Exactly and it appears that the son speaks German in Germany. In this day and age there is nothing to be embarrassed about an accent 
96,3,5eab5e9cd5ea945196f999fa,fulfilledHippo,2020-05-01T02:18:06.721Z,"I think it was kind of rude to not include his mother, but it seems like it wasn't an intentionally mean-spirited thing."
96,3,5eab7490d5ea945196f9cac7,delightedOtter,2020-05-01T02:18:22.583Z,He should try to encourage his husband to practice while they're home and should talk to his mom to make sure she doesn't create a judgey environment if he messes up.
96,3,5eab7490d5ea945196f9cac7,delightedOtter,2020-05-01T02:18:44.088Z,(He should encourage him to speak English in the U.S. is what I meant)
96,3,5eab7454d5ea945196f9c9ef,openMonkey,2020-05-01T02:19:06.055Z,Or the husband could be judgmental of the Mother in law
96,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762e26,brightElephant,2020-05-01T02:20:17.928Z,The son wanted to make his husband comfortable and didn't consider his mother's feelings. The mother could have tried conversing them in English more. I don't anyone's an asshole .
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:36:35.058Z,"I don't think that the person is the asshole, I think the husband is."
97,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762772,openMonkey,2020-05-01T01:36:48.874Z,The husband is in the wrong here
97,1,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,novelGiraffe,2020-05-01T01:36:51.427Z,I think this person is the asshole for making fun of him
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:36:53.040Z,I think asking a spouse to help your family out for 10 minutes at a time once in a while is not a big deal at all.
97,1,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,novelGiraffe,2020-05-01T01:37:00.679Z,True
97,1,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T01:37:04.700Z,I think that if she can say her husband can take 10 mins out of his time why can’t she 
97,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-05-01T01:37:07.566Z,I feel he is not an asshole because I don't think it is too much to ask that his husband help out family from time to time. 
97,1,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,novelGiraffe,2020-05-01T01:37:13.527Z,But can't she translate as well?
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:37:18.909Z,If this was something where the husband was being bothered nonstop then I would understand it.
97,1,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T01:37:28.160Z,Or at least they can alternate who steps up and translates 
97,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f5e,curiousBear,2020-05-01T01:37:31.355Z,I think the daughter is the asshole for thinking her husband should be responsible most of the time for the translation.
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:37:43.360Z,She can translate it but the way she explained it was she didn't have time.
97,1,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T01:37:47.513Z,I agree it doesn’t sound like it’s constant for the husband 
97,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762027,excitedHorse,2020-05-01T01:37:48.756Z,It's hard to tell how often teh husband is really bing asked to do things
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:37:51.687Z,She is working full time and is going for her masters degree.
97,1,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,novelGiraffe,2020-05-01T01:37:53.011Z,She seems pretty entitled.
97,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762772,openMonkey,2020-05-01T01:37:57.652Z,apparently the husband has a lot of freetime 
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:37:57.956Z,Exactly excitedHorse I agree.
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:38:07.302Z,We really need more information on how often the husband is actually being asked to translate.
97,1,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T01:38:07.556Z,Yes but she still should make time for her family 
97,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-05-01T01:38:09.566Z,If I were the husband I wouldn't mind helping out time to time. 
97,1,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T01:38:17.603Z,Maybe the husband works a lot too we don’t know 
97,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762027,excitedHorse,2020-05-01T01:38:18.102Z,"If it's like an every day thing, then she's the asshole. If it's like sometimes the parents call on the weekends for help with something, he should just do it."
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:38:18.364Z,"But the way she explained it, 10 minutes once in a while...that's not a big deal at all."
97,1,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,novelGiraffe,2020-05-01T01:38:25.621Z,Agreed
97,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-05-01T01:38:31.629Z,Agreed
97,1,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T01:38:34.977Z,Agree 
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:38:38.309Z,This is one of those situations where it's kind of impossible to accuractely judge.
97,1,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,novelGiraffe,2020-05-01T01:38:38.326Z,I do not like that he expects the parents to learn English now
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:38:42.989Z,We need the husbands point of view too
97,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f5e,curiousBear,2020-05-01T01:38:46.034Z,"Although she is working and attending school, I think she should not completely abdicate her responsibility to help translate and not put the full responsibility on the husband."
97,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762027,excitedHorse,2020-05-01T01:38:52.880Z,"But she also could be trying to make it sound like it's less than it is, lol"
97,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762772,openMonkey,2020-05-01T01:38:55.500Z,yes we do need his point of view
97,1,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,novelGiraffe,2020-05-01T01:38:55.522Z,very true delightedZebra
97,1,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T01:38:59.723Z,Agree
97,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-05-01T01:39:08.620Z,I think hearing his side would help 
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:39:11.840Z,"With the information we were given, he's more in the wrong IMO"
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:39:17.287Z,Probably more to the story but that's all we were given
97,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-05-01T01:39:17.341Z,Yes
97,1,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,novelGiraffe,2020-05-01T01:39:20.315Z,Sounds like the parents don't even call her anymore!
97,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762027,excitedHorse,2020-05-01T01:39:42.444Z,"If her story is totally accurate, maybe he is the asshole. I'm not totally sure though."
97,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f5e,curiousBear,2020-05-01T01:39:59.288Z,"Even at their age, the parents could be encouraged to learn English.  It would be a worthwhile project in my opinion.  "
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:40:01.604Z,Yeah it's impossible to know for sure.
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:40:09.458Z,I do think the parents should try to learn English though.
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:40:16.015Z,At least give it a chance as it would make their lives easier too.
97,1,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,novelGiraffe,2020-05-01T01:40:18.682Z,Do we think she is the asshole?
97,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-05-01T01:40:23.003Z,I do see how she needs more time for her family but I still think the husband is in the wrong.
97,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762027,excitedHorse,2020-05-01T01:40:26.840Z,"Oh yeah, they definitely should. It sounds like they've been in the US for 10 years."
97,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762772,openMonkey,2020-05-01T01:40:27.714Z,there is a lot of tools to make learning a new language easier
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:40:30.705Z,I do not think she is
97,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-05-01T01:40:30.779Z,I don't 
97,1,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T01:40:38.546Z,I agree they should learn but if they need help should be able to ask their daughter or son in law once in a while
97,1,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,novelGiraffe,2020-05-01T01:40:53.112Z,I have changed my mind and now I think she is not an asshole anymore
97,1,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T01:41:02.788Z,Agree 
97,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-05-01T01:41:06.785Z,agree
97,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762772,openMonkey,2020-05-01T01:41:09.050Z,agree
97,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762027,excitedHorse,2020-05-01T01:41:12.387Z,"Okay, let's go with that"
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:41:15.099Z,I just don't think someone being asked to sacrifice 10 minutes of their time on a phone call is a big ask of someone
97,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f5e,curiousBear,2020-05-01T01:41:15.702Z,I do understand the husband's reluctance to be the translator but he could probably be somewhat more helpful and kind in offering help.  
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:41:21.370Z,"So she isn't the asshole, he is."
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:41:25.615Z,At least according to the info we got
97,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-05-01T01:41:30.764Z,She is not an asshole. 
97,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762772,openMonkey,2020-05-01T01:41:35.570Z,yes from the picture she painted the husband is the asshole
97,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-05-01T01:41:38.845Z,Until I see other info lol
97,1,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,novelGiraffe,2020-05-01T01:41:59.428Z,"But we are being asked if she is the asshole, correct?"
97,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f5e,curiousBear,2020-05-01T01:42:13.360Z,"I, too, can agree that perhaps the daughter is not the asshole but the family needs to work out a system where one person is not charged with the responsibility of translating most of the time.  "
97,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-05-01T01:42:14.923Z,This person is not an asshole. 
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:42:21.969Z,We're being asked if she is the asshole.
97,1,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:42:27.544Z,And she is not in my opinion.
97,1,5d482ea321c9be351f762027,excitedHorse,2020-05-01T01:42:28.476Z,"Yeah, we're being asked if the author is the asshole"
97,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,inquisitiveDolphin,2020-05-01T01:42:49.658Z,She did not ask too much of her husband I feel so she is not an asshole to me. 
97,1,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T01:43:12.366Z,I agree she is not an asshole 
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:51:30.874Z,I don't think this person is the asshole.
97,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,fulfilledBison,2020-05-01T01:51:31.700Z,This guy is totally an asshole
97,2,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,novelElephant,2020-05-01T01:51:43.486Z,I don’t think so he said he was respectful 
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:52:00.047Z,"I think after he explained that he was willing to help and was polite and respectful, he cleared himself of being the asshole."
97,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762772,excitedHippo,2020-05-01T01:52:01.595Z,what he said wasn't respectful
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:52:06.521Z,It's not his responsibility to be a translator 24 hours a day.
97,2,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,novelElephant,2020-05-01T01:52:11.610Z,I think he would still be willing to help just they also need to commit to learning english
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:52:15.185Z,If it was every once in a while it would be understandable.
97,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,livelyZebra,2020-05-01T01:52:18.230Z,I think the way the guy talked was like an asshole but if he spoke respectfully to his mother in law about learning English he wasn't one in the situation.
97,2,5d482ea321c9be351f762027,eagerMonkey,2020-05-01T01:52:23.859Z,"I think he came off harsh because of his language, but he actually sounded kind of sincere"
97,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,fulfilledBison,2020-05-01T01:52:25.754Z,"I think when dealing with family members, it should have been the wife that said something, not him"
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:52:28.481Z,He also said he was willing to help the mother in law any way he could.
97,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762772,excitedHippo,2020-05-01T01:52:31.149Z,but if he is being called randomly throughout the whole day its a problem
97,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761f5e,delightedCamel,2020-05-01T01:52:42.055Z,I also believe he is an asshole .  I do not think he was respectful in dealing with his MIL.
97,2,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,novelElephant,2020-05-01T01:52:44.584Z,Yes it Is not clear how often he is being asked to help 
97,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,fulfilledBison,2020-05-01T01:53:05.530Z,"Just because he learned languages easily, does not mean that the mother in law will"
97,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,livelyZebra,2020-05-01T01:53:13.636Z,Honestly it would be hard to deal with calls all day if she can't even order food for herself so I get the frustration. 
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:53:14.343Z,I agree with that fulfilledBison
97,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762772,excitedHippo,2020-05-01T01:53:15.126Z,agreed
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:53:22.078Z,But that doesn't mean she shouldn't at least try to learn the language.
97,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761f5e,delightedCamel,2020-05-01T01:53:23.287Z,"Even though he said he was willing to help the MIL, he tone and words were disrespectful in my opinion."

97,2,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,novelElephant,2020-05-01T01:53:30.672Z,Yes that is true may be harder for his mother in law to learn but she should at least try 
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:53:35.810Z,"It seems like she doesn't even want to learn, she just wants everything done her way and in her language."
97,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,livelyZebra,2020-05-01T01:53:40.178Z,But I know not everyone learns English easily or any other language. 
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:53:40.845Z,That's just not the reality in the USA
97,2,5d482ea321c9be351f762027,eagerMonkey,2020-05-01T01:53:49.419Z,"Like I can understand needs help with taxes or applying for something but if you can't interact with people at the store or something, that's a real pain."
97,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762772,excitedHippo,2020-05-01T01:53:54.973Z,yeah she definitely should learn some of the very basics though 
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:53:56.933Z,"If she put effort into learning and just wasn't getting it, I'd be way more understanding."
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:54:21.841Z,The guy is probably getting calls all day about how to translate very minor things.
97,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,livelyZebra,2020-05-01T01:54:28.434Z,I can see both sides but he sounded so harsh I think it puts people off.
97,2,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,novelElephant,2020-05-01T01:54:35.549Z,Yes I agree his tone is bad 
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:54:38.833Z,I just think everyone has a breaking point.
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:54:47.240Z,His tone was bad but he also cleared it up and said he was polite and respectful.
97,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,fulfilledBison,2020-05-01T01:54:47.280Z,"What does flaunting ""white priveledge"" have to do with anything?"
97,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761f5e,delightedCamel,2020-05-01T01:54:51.446Z,It would be a good thing if the mother in law used available resources to learn English.  It would probably ease the tensions.
97,2,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,novelElephant,2020-05-01T01:54:52.939Z,But if he really was respectful to her then I don’t think he’s the asshole 
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:55:03.353Z,I just don't think he's an asshole.
97,2,5d482ea321c9be351f762027,eagerMonkey,2020-05-01T01:55:07.592Z,But I think his tone and language being bad is something we should kind of ignore. It makes him look worse than maybe he's really acting.
97,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,livelyZebra,2020-05-01T01:55:11.921Z,I don't either
97,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762772,excitedHippo,2020-05-01T01:55:13.566Z,seems like he is being called all day and it just got to him I don't think he is the asshole
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:55:16.321Z,Asking someone to try to learn a language is 100% a fine thing to do
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:55:25.896Z,Not trying and just using someone as a translator 24/7 is wrong
97,2,5d482ea321c9be351f762027,eagerMonkey,2020-05-01T01:55:28.657Z,I would say not the asshole too.
97,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761f5e,delightedCamel,2020-05-01T01:55:36.646Z,He thinks he was respectful but I disagree.  He could have phrased it more kindly. 
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:55:43.407Z,I highly doubt this guy is flipping out over translating a few things a month
97,2,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,novelElephant,2020-05-01T01:55:45.527Z,Yes I agree not the asshole 
97,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,fulfilledBison,2020-05-01T01:55:46.101Z,"But he said that the mother in law ""sometimes"" calls."
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:55:48.995Z,It has to be quite often for him to be this frustrated
97,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,fulfilledBison,2020-05-01T01:56:03.495Z,It doesn't sound like she calls as much as is told
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:56:09.080Z,It's hard to say.
97,2,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,novelElephant,2020-05-01T01:56:09.865Z,Yes or he has a low breaking point 
97,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,livelyZebra,2020-05-01T01:56:14.528Z,Yeah I could see it being very annoying after awhile
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:56:20.110Z,I just don't think someone would be getting mad being called like 2-3 times a month
97,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,fulfilledBison,2020-05-01T01:56:25.383Z,And she calls when she can't get ahold of someone else
97,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,fulfilledBison,2020-05-01T01:56:41.893Z,So she doesn't even call him first
97,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761f5e,delightedCamel,2020-05-01T01:56:44.775Z,The MIH should be strongly encouraged to learn English and the family should be supportive.  Perhaps she lacks confidence and needs someone to encourage her.  
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:56:48.022Z,The last thing someone wants to do when they get home from work is be hounded and having to do things that they don't want to do
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:56:50.711Z,We all just want to relax
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:57:09.169Z,This person is not the asshole in my opinion.
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:57:14.068Z,I don't think the mother in law is either.
97,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762772,excitedHippo,2020-05-01T01:57:15.727Z,She should attempt to learn english
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:57:20.524Z,I just think there's no asshole in this situation.
97,2,5eab726ad5ea945196f9c0ed,novelElephant,2020-05-01T01:57:22.862Z,I still don’t think the person in the assshole based on what we know 
97,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7630ba,livelyZebra,2020-05-01T01:57:33.312Z,I don't think they are an asshole and I feel she should at least try to learn English. 
97,2,5eab6e5ad5ea945196f9b094,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T01:57:39.443Z,Same livelyZebra
97,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761d3e,fulfilledBison,2020-05-01T01:58:18.838Z,This was a hard scenario!
98,0,5d482ea321c9be351f76201f,fulfilledZebra,2020-05-01T00:51:11.777Z,I think they both were assholes to be honest

98,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763740,openBison,2020-05-01T00:51:40.261Z,I think they both were having a hard time seeing things from the other person's point of view.
98,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7631ed,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T00:51:42.878Z,I think he is the asshole
98,0,5d482ea321c9be351f76201f,fulfilledZebra,2020-05-01T00:51:59.138Z,They can come to a conclusion together on this. She shouldn't expect him to drop everything.
98,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762eb1,novelDolphin,2020-05-01T00:52:02.342Z,it was one thing once in a while to have the mom ask him directly but to do is consistantly that should be her responsibility or at least split it
98,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763f5c,delightedGiraffe,2020-05-01T00:52:05.335Z,"I think if he was uncomfortable with the task, then she was an asshole for continuing to put this on him."
98,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763f5c,delightedGiraffe,2020-05-01T00:52:20.910Z,There are lots of translation apps out there.
98,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7631ed,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T00:52:29.974Z,I think she shouldn

98,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763740,openBison,2020-05-01T00:52:51.823Z,She was very busy working and school full time but she wasn't willing to see his point of view that he wasn't comfortable with her mom calling him directly. However it would have been nice if he could understand how busy she was.
98,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763f5c,delightedGiraffe,2020-05-01T00:52:53.173Z,"Yes, they were both assholes."
98,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762eb1,novelDolphin,2020-05-01T00:52:57.061Z,great point delightedGiraffe
98,0,5d482ea321c9be351f76201f,fulfilledZebra,2020-05-01T00:52:57.403Z,maybe they could work together to teach her parents more english
98,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763740,openBison,2020-05-01T00:53:23.797Z,Helping her parents become more proficient in English would be a good goal for both of them.
98,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763740,openBison,2020-05-01T00:53:33.875Z,Or all four of them rather.
98,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763f5c,delightedGiraffe,2020-05-01T00:53:36.701Z,She does state that it was once in a while and not a daily occurence
98,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762b0a,excitedHorse,2020-05-01T00:53:39.879Z,I think he is the asshole. He might have asked nicely and communicate his concerns. On the other hand she is being melodramatic without seating and talking with him. When you get married there are some things that need to be compromised.
98,0,5d482ea321c9be351f76201f,fulfilledZebra,2020-05-01T00:53:52.964Z,"Considering we aren't sure of his tone when he said he was uncomfortable with this, we could assume maybe he didn't speak up soon enough and has let it go on. "
98,0,5d482ea321c9be351f76201f,fulfilledZebra,2020-05-01T00:54:10.356Z,so he could be mildly at fault for not standing up for himself too
98,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7631ed,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T00:54:20.046Z,I think she shouldn't put him in that position where he is getting irritated. Of course he's her husband and her family is like his family but it doesn't matter the situation is.
98,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763f5c,delightedGiraffe,2020-05-01T00:54:57.140Z,they both should be more understanding of each other.

98,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763f5c,delightedGiraffe,2020-05-01T00:56:09.970Z,so do we all agree that they are both equally at fault?
98,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7631ed,eagerOtter,2020-05-01T00:56:13.257Z,and also he shouldn't get irritated for helping out the eldest its not like they know because if they do know on their own they wouldn't even bother for his help
98,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763740,openBison,2020-05-01T00:56:13.291Z,So how many chose her as AH?

98,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762eb1,livelyCamel,2020-05-01T01:08:27.613Z,but there is so many resources they can use

98,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f5c,lightOtter,2020-05-01T01:10:13.854Z,The language thing is the problem because it is unnecessary and unthoughtful. Maybe he's in the middle of something at work which is crucial and there goes his cell phoone ringing to ask for a translation.
98,1,5d482ea321c9be351f76201f,novelBear,2020-05-01T01:10:14.463Z,I felt the same way. I think there is just a communication breakdown and someone isn't talking about their feelings
98,1,5d482ea321c9be351f76201f,novelBear,2020-05-01T01:10:34.055Z,He could definitely set up boundaries

98,1,5d482ea321c9be351f76201f,novelBear,2020-05-01T01:10:51.104Z,setting up boundaries is more appropriate and healthy than doing what he did 
98,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762eb1,livelyCamel,2020-05-01T01:11:01.735Z,Boundaries are key in any relationship and in this scenario they clearly need to be developed.

100,0,5d482ea121c9be351f761d83,fulfilledElephant,2020-05-01T00:31:31.400Z,There was nothing that said he was the translator every day for the rest of his life
100,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761db6,delightedCamel,2020-05-01T00:31:47.483Z,He said he did offer her all the tools he used. He likely works for a living and does not have time to teach a class.

100,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7624c5,inquisitiveZebra,2020-05-01T00:32:03.572Z,I also like the idea of hiring someone to help with translating.  It would be better to focus on him not being able to do so many tasks and not make it about the mother's language skills.

100,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761d83,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T01:00:01.227Z,especially for an immigrant who may not have had a prior education
100,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761d40,livelyHippo,2020-05-01T01:00:07.469Z,I think they expect him to drop everything with no notice. 
100,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761db6,excitedOtter,2020-05-01T01:00:09.490Z,That's part of moving to a new country. Communication is important.

100,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761d74,lightGiraffe,2020-05-01T01:00:37.465Z,Yeah needs effort
100,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761db6,excitedOtter,2020-05-01T01:00:58.332Z,I think he is justified in his feeling.
100,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761c46,delightedElephant,2020-05-01T01:01:09.455Z,I think if we knew the parents were actually making an effort to learn english it would be different.  It sounds like they have relied on their daughter instead

101,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762b52,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T00:57:39.745Z,Hello?
101,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762b74,livelyCamel,2020-05-01T00:57:40.216Z,I don't think the writer is an asshole.  But I think he/she could be a little more considerate of the spouse.
101,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762ddf,inquisitiveBear,2020-05-01T00:57:41.472Z,"Every now and then would be okay, but just expecting the husband to drop what he's doing at any given time to translate is just inconsiderate and rude of the writer."
101,2,5d482eab21c9be351f764109,delightedBison,2020-05-01T00:57:52.532Z,"Like they could've compensated the husband for their time, or split the load with him"
101,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762b74,livelyCamel,2020-05-01T00:58:07.996Z,I also think the writer should help and encourage the parents to learn English
101,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763561,brightMonkey,2020-05-01T00:58:33.770Z,"That's understandable, but it really is a difficult to encourage Spanish parents to learn English"
101,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762b52,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T00:58:45.142Z,I think that the parents should learn english too but in the mean time they do not know it
101,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762ddf,inquisitiveBear,2020-05-01T00:58:46.909Z,It would get annoying when you are in the middle of something and out of the blue you have to take your focus away from what you're doing to handle the business of people who really should have learned english.
101,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762b52,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T00:59:25.381Z,So the husband could help they did say it was once in a while
101,2,5d482eab21c9be351f764109,delightedBison,2020-05-01T00:59:37.681Z,"I understand and agree with that, it doesn't really matter if they ""aren't doing much anyway"", thrusting something upon someone is just plain rude."
101,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762b74,livelyCamel,2020-05-01T00:59:38.237Z,I think that the writer and the spouse could help the parents to learn English.  I believe that if you truly want to have a successful life in a foreign country you should try to learn the native language.
101,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762ddf,inquisitiveBear,2020-05-01T00:59:50.090Z,"It should be the hard and fast rule that if you want to be a citizen of America, then you must learn english to do so."

101,2,5d482eab21c9be351f764109,delightedBison,2020-05-01T00:59:58.660Z,"So I guess they are ""the asshole"" to an extent"
101,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762b52,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T01:00:15.815Z,Yes to a point but
101,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762b52,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T01:00:38.137Z,the husband needs to understand he married into this
101,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762b74,livelyCamel,2020-05-01T01:00:46.702Z,"I think under the circumstances, they are all a little bit of an asshole.  "

101,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762b52,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T01:01:10.216Z,exactly
101,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762b52,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T01:01:21.610Z,so what do we agree
101,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762b74,livelyCamel,2020-05-01T01:01:23.752Z,"Yes, perhaps there is a little bit of laziness there. And the husband is resentful."
101,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763561,brightMonkey,2020-05-01T01:01:28.642Z,It is lazy but they also stated how busy they are in their day to day life.
101,2,5d482ea621c9be351f762b74,livelyCamel,2020-05-01T01:01:54.209Z,I think that this discussion has made me change my mind!
101,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762ddf,inquisitiveBear,2020-05-01T01:01:58.267Z,"Like previously stated, it should just be the law that everyone wanting to be a citizen has to learn english.]"

101,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762b74,curiousZebra,2020-05-01T01:12:20.950Z,He is helping.  
101,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764109,excitedElephant,2020-05-01T01:12:43.861Z,"Like it's definitely rude to force someone to be ""on call"" for translation efforts, but the way he flaunted hi fluency in other languages comes off as super pretentious."

101,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762b52,openBison,2020-05-01T01:13:23.752Z,he is the asshole though

101,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762ddf,inquisitiveCamel,2020-05-01T01:13:36.738Z,The wife and the parents are the assholes for expecting him to drop what he is doing whenever they want to use him to translate.

101,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762b74,curiousZebra,2020-05-01T01:16:43.090Z,Why not? He said that he was respectful to his inlaws.
101,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764109,excitedElephant,2020-05-01T01:17:10.170Z,Everyone who isn't respectful says they're respectful

102,1,5ea9d2fca68ffa2bcbe13a4e,eagerMonkey,2020-05-01T00:37:21.729Z,In my opinion this person is the asshole.
102,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762940,excitedHorse,2020-05-01T00:37:30.953Z,I think this person is the asshole as well.
102,1,5d407d8011e92e314fcda15f,livelyZebra,2020-05-01T00:37:33.878Z,I think the person is the asshole because they've chosen to not speak english when they all can.
102,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b2,fulfilledElephant,2020-05-01T00:37:48.380Z,i think this person is the asshole too 
102,1,5d482ea721c9be351f763043,curiousCamel,2020-05-01T00:37:50.973Z,My initial impression is there is a huge misunderstanding between OP and his mom. She may not know the whole situation as to why his husband refuses to speak English.
102,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762940,excitedHorse,2020-05-01T00:37:51.530Z,"Yes, especially since the visit was specifically to be with his mother and it's in her home."
102,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7626b8,novelBear,2020-05-01T00:37:52.215Z,I believe the person is the asshole.
102,1,5ea9d2fca68ffa2bcbe13a4e,eagerMonkey,2020-05-01T00:38:01.889Z,"If the mother is graciously letting them stay at the house, they should be speaking english if that's what she wants or they can go elsewhere"
102,1,5d407d8011e92e314fcda15f,livelyZebra,2020-05-01T00:38:06.762Z,And she's feeding them and taking care of them
102,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b2,fulfilledElephant,2020-05-01T00:38:24.749Z,The husband can speak some English but I think its a bigger factor that the son spoke mostly German.
102,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762940,excitedHorse,2020-05-01T00:38:26.828Z,The husband is never going to get comfortable with it if he doesn't start trying to speak english .
102,1,5ea9d2fca68ffa2bcbe13a4e,eagerMonkey,2020-05-01T00:38:33.383Z,"The mother cares about her son and wants to catch up, and he's being rude and not letting her do that. "
102,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b2,fulfilledElephant,2020-05-01T00:38:48.052Z,He could carve out more time to include his mom and catch up rather than speak almost exclusively in German.
102,1,5d407d8011e92e314fcda15f,livelyZebra,2020-05-01T00:38:49.192Z,I think they're both assholes.
102,1,5d482ea721c9be351f763043,curiousCamel,2020-05-01T00:38:52.814Z,You make a decent point. The son could have easily translated for his mother as well
102,1,5ea9d2fca68ffa2bcbe13a4e,eagerMonkey,2020-05-01T00:39:02.532Z,I agree that the husband won't be able to become comfortable with it if he doesn't practice 
102,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7626b8,novelBear,2020-05-01T00:39:14.744Z,"The husband should understand the mom's POV because she is providing them housing and meals, even though it makes him uncomfortable. The mom just wants to understand them."
102,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762940,excitedHorse,2020-05-01T00:39:17.229Z,It's not like he's giving a speech in front of a bunch of strangers. Its his mother in law.
102,1,5ea9d2fca68ffa2bcbe13a4e,eagerMonkey,2020-05-01T00:39:30.444Z,"They could have all had a talk about it, instead of him throwing a fit and posting on the internet about it"
102,1,5d407d8011e92e314fcda15f,livelyZebra,2020-05-01T00:39:37.266Z,I know the mom feels totally left out
102,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b2,fulfilledElephant,2020-05-01T00:39:58.888Z,I think it's ultimately about trying to balance the attention to his mom and husband but his mom definitely deserves more attention than she got since they are visiting her.
102,1,5ea9d2fca68ffa2bcbe13a4e,eagerMonkey,2020-05-01T00:40:15.326Z,The mom might think they're talking about her if they have the ability to speak english but don't. it might make her feel uncomfortable as well. 
102,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762940,excitedHorse,2020-05-01T00:40:19.165Z,True. Should never post family business on the internet in my opinion
102,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7626b8,novelBear,2020-05-01T00:40:35.790Z,"Agreed, they should at least include her as she is providing them housing and meals."
102,1,5d407d8011e92e314fcda15f,livelyZebra,2020-05-01T00:40:44.366Z,"If you've ever been in a room where everyone is speaking a language you don't speak, it's very isolating."
102,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b2,fulfilledElephant,2020-05-01T00:41:01.263Z,I think the moms POV is very understandable
102,1,5ea9d2fca68ffa2bcbe13a4e,eagerMonkey,2020-05-01T00:41:07.754Z,The son is whiny. He should be considering both sides and work to make a compromise
102,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b2,fulfilledElephant,2020-05-01T00:41:25.234Z,I agree
102,1,5d482ea721c9be351f763043,curiousCamel,2020-05-01T00:41:46.762Z,Maybe they should try teaching her German while working on improving the husbands so he can see how it is from her end as well
102,1,5d407d8011e92e314fcda15f,livelyZebra,2020-05-01T00:41:53.257Z,"He should have at least spoken in english and if hubs wanted to speak in german, he could translate"
102,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7626b8,novelBear,2020-05-01T00:42:07.598Z,It is indeed very isolating when you are in a room where everyone is speaking a language that you don't understand. You just want to be included.
102,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762940,excitedHorse,2020-05-01T00:42:09.518Z,Good idea. But it may be harder for her to learn a new language if she's older
102,1,5ea9d2fca68ffa2bcbe13a4e,eagerMonkey,2020-05-01T00:42:11.189Z,I agree 
102,1,5d407d8011e92e314fcda15f,livelyZebra,2020-05-01T00:43:09.265Z,Yes this person is the asshole for not speaking english to his mom.
102,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762940,excitedHorse,2020-05-01T00:43:29.360Z,Yes this person is the asshole. He is at his mother's visiting and should put her needs first. 
102,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b2,fulfilledElephant,2020-05-01T00:43:41.715Z,I agree. This person is the asshole and should've considered his mom's POV more
102,3,5ea9d2fca68ffa2bcbe13a4e,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:07:02.513Z,I don't think she was being an asshole

102,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763043,fulfilledHippo,2020-05-01T01:07:14.979Z,I believe it was more the son being the asshole
102,3,5d407d8011e92e314fcda15f,curiousElephant,2020-05-01T01:07:21.726Z,I don't either. Everyone could speak english so they should have to be polite
102,3,5ea9d2fca68ffa2bcbe13a4e,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:07:22.978Z,I agree

102,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7626b8,inspiredMonkey,2020-05-01T01:07:32.546Z,She wasn't being the asshole at all.
102,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b2,livelyBear,2020-05-01T01:07:37.192Z,They were staying at her home anyway so they shouldn't exclude her 
102,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762940,openGiraffe,2020-05-01T01:07:40.644Z,They are all in her house and they all speak English. 
102,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763043,fulfilledHippo,2020-05-01T01:07:46.478Z,It sounded like the partner was having a bit of a childish fit
102,3,5ea9d2fca68ffa2bcbe13a4e,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:07:53.372Z,"It's her house, so if she wants them to speak english and they are capable of doing so, they should speak english "

102,3,5d407d8011e92e314fcda15f,curiousElephant,2020-05-01T01:08:07.930Z,I think it was an intentional snub
102,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b2,livelyBear,2020-05-01T01:08:24.906Z,"I understand if when the son and husband are alone they speak French, but when they are all together they should speak English."

102,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7626b8,inspiredMonkey,2020-05-01T01:08:56.795Z,Wouldn't anyone else feel isolated if everyone else in the room spoke a language that you couldn't understand? 
102,3,5d407d8011e92e314fcda15f,curiousElephant,2020-05-01T01:09:03.445Z,They were purposefully excluding her from the conversation. It was rude behavior.
102,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b2,livelyBear,2020-05-01T01:09:08.409Z,I also think she handled it well telling them she felt disrespected and their reactions were a little extreme
102,3,5ea9d2fca68ffa2bcbe13a4e,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:09:10.947Z,It's part of life for people to disagree. if the mother was respsectful with what she said the partner shouldn't have just barged off and threw a fit
102,3,5ea9d2fca68ffa2bcbe13a4e,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:09:19.762Z,I agree that she handled it well

102,3,5d482ea721c9be351f763043,fulfilledHippo,2020-05-01T01:10:09.733Z,She did ask nicely. The son should have apologized and spoken to his partner about his behavior.

102,3,5ea9d2fca68ffa2bcbe13a4e,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:11:41.779Z,and the son could have said that they needed to have a private conversation 
102,3,5ea9d2fca68ffa2bcbe13a4e,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:12:04.995Z,another good point inspiredMonkey
102,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7626b8,inspiredMonkey,2020-05-01T01:12:05.357Z,How they handled it was disrespectful
102,3,5d482ea921c9be351f7636b2,livelyBear,2020-05-01T01:12:09.250Z,I think it was a poorly handled situation that probably just needed communication and a full conversation.
102,3,5d407d8011e92e314fcda15f,curiousElephant,2020-05-01T01:12:09.325Z,Speaking only french was a way to exclude the mother. he was doing that on purpose.

102,3,5ea9d2fca68ffa2bcbe13a4e,delightedZebra,2020-05-01T01:12:12.612Z,very disrespectful 
102,3,5d407d8011e92e314fcda15f,curiousElephant,2020-05-01T01:13:17.580Z,The person is not the asshole. She politely asked that they be respectful and include her in the conversation.

103,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625f2,eagerBear,2020-05-01T00:25:39.273Z,"I don't think she's an asshole, just inconsiderate for not asking her husband if he was okay with it."
103,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d63,inspiredGiraffe,2020-05-01T00:25:42.939Z,hello
103,2,5eab5f96d5ea945196f99a08,lightBison,2020-05-01T00:25:48.135Z,I think that she is able to translate for her parents and her husband shouldn't be expected to do it all the time
103,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,inquisitiveCamel,2020-05-01T00:25:57.906Z,"I do not think she is the asshole, yet. If she keeps sending her parent's translation q's to her husband after he expressed his concern, I'd say she was "
103,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d63,inspiredGiraffe,2020-05-01T00:26:10.890Z,I think the writer's husband is being a bit too inflexible here.
103,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625f2,eagerBear,2020-05-01T00:26:11.694Z,"Yes, she should talk to her mother about it."
103,2,5ea885dc7d50722703c53e04,novelOtter,2020-05-01T00:26:13.814Z,I think the word making at the end really got to me. Making the husband translate put her in the wrong. If she was asking or if it was only occasionally that would be different.
103,2,5eab5f96d5ea945196f99a08,lightBison,2020-05-01T00:26:30.283Z,although he did not react in an appropriate manner
103,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,inquisitiveCamel,2020-05-01T00:26:32.023Z,She can't assume her husband has the same family values she does (or should have figured that out before tieing the knot) -)
103,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625f2,eagerBear,2020-05-01T00:26:40.542Z,How many things can she need to translate? I can't image it is all day long.
103,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d63,inspiredGiraffe,2020-05-01T00:26:55.190Z,The husband's response about how the family should have learned by now may be carrying too much weight in my mind.
103,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,inquisitiveCamel,2020-05-01T00:27:02.081Z,sounds like he let his resentment build up.
103,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762cc9,openZebra,2020-05-01T00:27:22.929Z,I don't she is the asshole. But I can see him getting frustrated if it's a constant thing. Asking for help every day or multiple times a day.
103,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,inquisitiveCamel,2020-05-01T00:27:26.059Z,"I agree, he just can't assume the family will earn english "
103,2,5eab5f96d5ea945196f99a08,lightBison,2020-05-01T00:27:44.754Z,I also agree that he shouldn't blame them for not learning english
103,2,5ea885dc7d50722703c53e04,novelOtter,2020-05-01T00:27:47.160Z,Does his being in the wrong impact what she is doing?
103,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625f2,eagerBear,2020-05-01T00:27:47.712Z,I think I would be honored if my in-laws felt comfortable having me translate things for them though.
103,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,inquisitiveCamel,2020-05-01T00:27:49.215Z,learn*
103,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762cc9,openZebra,2020-05-01T00:27:56.745Z,it's also a little late for them to fully learn english at this stage in life.
103,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d63,inspiredGiraffe,2020-05-01T00:28:18.840Z,"I think there is plenty of blame to go around.  The writer shouldn't have assumed he should do it all.  The husband should be willing to do more, and the mother / mother-in-law might be a bit ungrateful."
103,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,inquisitiveCamel,2020-05-01T00:28:28.464Z,"Yes, and it's a way for him to bond with her family. Why does he not appreciate that?"
103,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625f2,eagerBear,2020-05-01T00:28:28.762Z,"I agree. Although, the husband could offer to teach them some English during their translation sessions, if he's so adamant about it"
103,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,inquisitiveCamel,2020-05-01T00:28:37.945Z,v true
103,2,5eab5f96d5ea945196f99a08,lightBison,2020-05-01T00:28:55.053Z,so is she an asshole?
103,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625f2,eagerBear,2020-05-01T00:28:58.027Z,I definitely don't think she's an asshole
103,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762cc9,openZebra,2020-05-01T00:29:05.521Z,I don't either
103,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,inquisitiveCamel,2020-05-01T00:29:11.784Z,me either
103,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d63,inspiredGiraffe,2020-05-01T00:29:24.471Z,"So I guess I'm saying he's more than 51% of the asshole, which by these rules means she isn't."
103,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762cc9,openZebra,2020-05-01T00:29:30.207Z,i don't think he's the asshole either
103,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762cc9,openZebra,2020-05-01T00:29:38.259Z,sure lol
103,2,5ea885dc7d50722703c53e04,novelOtter,2020-05-01T00:29:47.178Z,So they both cant be assholes?
103,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625f2,eagerBear,2020-05-01T00:29:55.485Z,The question was if SHE was an asshole. 
103,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7625f2,eagerBear,2020-05-01T00:30:09.173Z,"She's not really, she probably didn't know he was upset before he said something"
103,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d63,inspiredGiraffe,2020-05-01T00:30:22.780Z,"Well, being literal it asks if a person is THE asshole, not AN asshole."
103,2,5ea885dc7d50722703c53e04,novelOtter,2020-05-01T00:30:32.413Z,"I think the way she phrased the question at the end, using the word making him translate, makes her one"
103,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d63,inspiredGiraffe,2020-05-01T00:30:47.895Z,"I'm going to say no, she is not."
103,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762cc9,openZebra,2020-05-01T00:31:02.874Z,i'm going to say no as well
103,3,5ea885dc7d50722703c53e04,openGorilla,2020-05-01T00:40:03.304Z,Absolutely he is.
103,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,curiousBear,2020-05-01T00:40:06.956Z,Oh he's an asshole
103,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7625f2,inspiredDolphin,2020-05-01T00:40:11.416Z,I agree. Total asshole

103,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7625f2,inspiredDolphin,2020-05-01T00:40:42.875Z,She doesn't have to learn English if she doesn't want.
103,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,curiousBear,2020-05-01T00:40:50.329Z,"oh yeah, his whole personality just shines through real ugly in that post"
103,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7625f2,inspiredDolphin,2020-05-01T00:40:51.924Z,I think even he knows he's an asshole
103,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,curiousBear,2020-05-01T00:40:55.828Z,lol
103,3,5eab5f96d5ea945196f99a08,novelHorse,2020-05-01T00:40:56.498Z,i think he can be frustrated from being called all the time but the language he uses to explain makes him a complete asshole to her
103,3,5ea885dc7d50722703c53e04,openGorilla,2020-05-01T00:41:00.374Z,The fact that she did not use him as her primary translator and only used him if she could not get ahold of other family members was a big thing for me. He could just not answer the phone. 
103,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7625f2,inspiredDolphin,2020-05-01T00:41:14.989Z,He could have just told his mother in law he wasn't comfortable translating all of the time'
103,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d63,delightedCamel,2020-05-01T00:41:18.833Z,"Good point, openGorilla"
103,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,curiousBear,2020-05-01T00:41:20.500Z,I agree that it's understandable to be frustrated by constant interruption
103,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,curiousBear,2020-05-01T00:41:49.662Z,If he's so annoyed why doesn't he just pay for a translator for her
103,3,5eab5f96d5ea945196f99a08,novelHorse,2020-05-01T00:42:03.239Z,that probably wouldn't look good on him either
103,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7625f2,inspiredDolphin,2020-05-01T00:42:06.626Z,Or offer to teach her himself

103,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7625f2,inspiredDolphin,2020-05-01T00:43:02.070Z,He sounds very bitter. And extremely privileged and cocky about his language knowledge. 
103,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,curiousBear,2020-05-01T00:43:09.532Z,very true
103,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762cc9,fulfilledMonkey,2020-05-01T00:43:18.690Z,at first i thought she was constantly call him to translate all the time. but he clearly said when she isn't able to get a hold of anyother family members
103,3,5eab5f96d5ea945196f99a08,novelHorse,2020-05-01T00:43:19.882Z,yes it's not easy for most people to learn a language in a year
103,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d63,delightedCamel,2020-05-01T00:43:22.950Z,"Because he learned multiple languages at a young age, he vastly underestimates how hard it would be for his in-laws.  "

103,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762cc9,fulfilledMonkey,2020-05-01T00:44:00.694Z,I do think it's not too much to pick up some key words or phrase to get by day to day
103,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,curiousBear,2020-05-01T00:44:06.333Z,"Yeah, just because he learns languages easily (not so humble brag) doesn't mean it's easy for everyone"
103,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762cc9,fulfilledMonkey,2020-05-01T00:44:29.051Z,but you shouldn't expect some one to just fully learn a language especially the older they are.

103,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,curiousBear,2020-05-01T00:45:01.751Z,It's part of the package if you ask me
103,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763d63,delightedCamel,2020-05-01T00:45:08.530Z,Is there any strong counter-point to be made?
103,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7625f2,inspiredDolphin,2020-05-01T00:45:09.372Z,I agree with that
103,3,5eab5f96d5ea945196f99a08,novelHorse,2020-05-01T00:45:11.060Z,i agree
103,3,5d482ea821c9be351f763391,curiousBear,2020-05-01T00:45:13.471Z,it's additional family you're taking on
103,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7625f2,inspiredDolphin,2020-05-01T00:45:27.443Z,It's hard to find a counterpoint.

104,2,5d0cec862c04075bfb1211a7,brightHorse,2020-04-30T22:56:42.946Z,if they could all carry a conversation on in english and choose not to then it's pretty rude to the mother

104,2,5d0cec862c04075bfb1211a7,brightHorse,2020-04-30T23:00:06.142Z,there is an issue since she is not being included
104,2,5eab48dad5ea945196f9688a,inquisitiveHippo,2020-04-30T23:00:21.049Z,Its not like anyone gets excluded if they speak english whereas someone is entirely excluded. Small inconvenience for inclusion.
104,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761c31,excitedGorilla,2020-04-30T23:00:52.011Z,Being included is not the same as speaking in English. What you're saying is that she just wants to eavesdrop

104,3,5d482ea121c9be351f761c31,lightHorse,2020-04-30T23:09:35.570Z,I think the mother overlooks her son-in-laws self-consciousness towards ESL
104,3,5eab48dad5ea945196f9688a,eagerZebra,2020-04-30T23:09:55.134Z,Slightly leaning towards asshole as well now. Expecting the partner to speak language that they are clearly uncomfortable with.
104,3,5d482ea421c9be351f76221a,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-04-30T23:10:02.820Z,"I'm thinking not an asshole on this. She may have been awkward, but she did express her feelings about her being uncomfortable."

104,3,5d0cec862c04075bfb1211a7,delightedBear,2020-04-30T23:10:57.001Z,i understand it may be uncomfortable for the partner but it's also uncomfortable for the poster to be excluded
104,3,5d482ea121c9be351f761c31,lightHorse,2020-04-30T23:10:57.548Z,I think the mother is overlooking this fact
104,3,5eab48dad5ea945196f9688a,eagerZebra,2020-04-30T23:11:08.017Z,"There definately may be more to the situation than we know and they don't live there on a normal basis. So it may be less enjoyable with language barrier, but more comfortable for the partner who has the difficulty."
104,3,5eab48dad5ea945196f9688a,eagerZebra,2020-04-30T23:11:18.162Z,Definately seems a little small-minded on the mother's part.
104,3,5d482ea421c9be351f76221a,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-04-30T23:11:23.585Z,I would feel more uncomfortable being left out than struggling to speak a language.
104,3,5d0cec862c04075bfb1211a7,delightedBear,2020-04-30T23:11:45.040Z,i think the poster could have gone about it in a better way maybe but i don't think they're being an asshole
104,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7622dc,inspiredBison,2020-04-30T23:11:50.740Z,I think the man's husband was being overly sensitive and irrational

104,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7622dc,inspiredBison,2020-04-30T23:12:25.532Z,I think the mother has the right in her own home to be included in conversations in English 
104,3,5d482ea121c9be351f761c31,lightHorse,2020-04-30T23:12:37.090Z,"But be honest, it wasn't the son-in-laws idea to go visit the mother"
104,3,5d0cec862c04075bfb1211a7,delightedBear,2020-04-30T23:12:52.908Z,the partner should be respectful to the poster who is letting him stay in her house
104,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7622dc,inspiredBison,2020-04-30T23:12:59.385Z,I do not understand the son and French partner excluding the mother when they bother know English
104,3,5d482ea421c9be351f76221a,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-04-30T23:13:01.021Z,I agree with lightHorse it should be on the son to figure a compromise.
104,3,5d482ea121c9be351f761c31,lightHorse,2020-04-30T23:13:05.879Z,"So that means he was probably dragged to a place he didn't want to go, and then forced to speak a language he didn't want to"
104,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7622dc,inspiredBison,2020-04-30T23:13:18.100Z,I think the son and his partner are assholes and not the mother
104,3,5d0cec862c04075bfb1211a7,delightedBear,2020-04-30T23:13:19.326Z,you're assuming things that were not stated
104,3,5eab48dad5ea945196f9688a,eagerZebra,2020-04-30T23:13:19.427Z,They are definately visiting so its not a permanant situation. With time they may also become more confortable since its also probably stressful living with an in-law.
104,3,5eab48dad5ea945196f9688a,eagerZebra,2020-04-30T23:13:47.495Z,It may not only be an ESL issue but one of just being nervous.

104,3,5d482ea121c9be351f761c31,lightHorse,2020-04-30T23:14:14.873Z,I hated speaking English around English speakers when I first started. The fact that they even bring up my accent is degrading to my English skills.
104,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7622dc,inspiredBison,2020-04-30T23:14:23.771Z,"The mother opened her home to them and deserves some respect and consideration from her son and his partner, and that starts with conversation in a language she understands"

105,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762c35,excitedOtter,2020-04-30T22:18:05.951Z,I think the languge he used in the post just shows his furstration to uis

105,0,5d482ea121c9be351f761bee,openGorilla,2020-04-30T22:22:43.358Z,Just because of his language and tone
105,0,5d482ea121c9be351f761bee,openGorilla,2020-04-30T22:22:54.372Z,But I see everyones point

105,3,5d40909011e92e314fcdae58,curiousHorse,2020-04-30T23:01:38.822Z,I think the wife is an asshole for expecting her husband to translate for her mother.

105,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762c35,openGiraffe,2020-04-30T23:02:13.427Z,"So I do believe that she is the asshole in this one. She needs to understand how her husband feels and can't be so expectant of her husband. Although she may think her husband has ""free time"", how does she know what her husband is doing?"
105,3,5d482ea121c9be351f761bee,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-30T23:02:15.593Z,"If she can go and get her MBA, she can take 30 minutes out of the day to set her parents up with Duolingo or something that will help them"

105,3,5d40909011e92e314fcdae58,curiousHorse,2020-04-30T23:02:19.184Z,It's a bandaid to ask the husband for help constanly
105,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762202,excitedBison,2020-04-30T23:02:34.077Z,I agree that this is the wife's problem. Her husband didn't sign up to be a translator.

105,3,5d40909011e92e314fcdae58,curiousHorse,2020-04-30T23:03:28.425Z,I agree it's very selfish to assume he is always able to help her mother.
105,3,5d482ea121c9be351f761bf0,inspiredHippo,2020-04-30T23:03:31.824Z,She could help them find the resources to learn English and be more independent.  What if no one was available when they needed help?
105,3,5d482ea121c9be351f761bee,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-30T23:03:34.301Z,I respect the husband for saying something.
105,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762202,excitedBison,2020-04-30T23:03:34.448Z,The husband seems to have done a lot already in terms of helping the family assimilate.

105,3,5d40909011e92e314fcdae58,curiousHorse,2020-04-30T23:07:40.816Z,She is being selfish to assume her husbands constant help. She is being an asshole.
106,0,5d43364cce0995585f1a5cbd,curiousBear,2020-04-30T22:13:06.985Z,I think the man needs to consider his MIL's age
106,0,5d43364cce0995585f1a5cbd,curiousBear,2020-04-30T22:13:34.544Z,It may be more difficult for her to learn a new language if she's older

106,0,5d482ea421c9be351f762333,brightMonkey,2020-04-30T22:14:14.711Z,He should have considered her ability and possible insecurity.

106,0,5d482ea421c9be351f762296,inspiredBison,2020-04-30T22:14:52.422Z,I think he should have expressed his frustration to his wife and asked to not be a contact person for translating if he's unhappy with it.
106,0,5d482ea421c9be351f762333,brightMonkey,2020-04-30T22:14:55.543Z,I feel he was definitely wrong in his approach. All agree?

106,0,5d482ea421c9be351f762333,brightMonkey,2020-04-30T22:16:23.903Z,Have we come to a consenus that he was in the wrong and definitely an Ahole in his reaction?
106,0,5d482ea421c9be351f762333,brightMonkey,2020-04-30T22:17:16.463Z,He has a life. But rudeness has no place.

106,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762296,livelyCamel,2020-04-30T22:58:03.363Z,I think the woman is asking far too much of her husband to be ready to translate at any time.
106,3,5d43364cce0995585f1a5cbd,excitedMonkey,2020-04-30T22:58:16.014Z,I also agree. 
106,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762956,brightHippo,2020-04-30T22:58:23.909Z,It is considerate and respectful to help family and friends when you are asked.

106,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762296,livelyCamel,2020-04-30T22:59:00.699Z,I agree brightHippo but this is happening often and throughout the day when the husband is busy
106,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762296,livelyCamel,2020-04-30T22:59:33.974Z,What other options does the daughter have to help her parents?
106,3,5d43364cce0995585f1a5cbd,excitedMonkey,2020-04-30T22:59:46.656Z,"But since it's the mother in law, I think the husband could spend some time teaching her."
106,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762956,brightHippo,2020-04-30T22:59:48.173Z,If a famiily member (older) called and asked  you to help clear out the garage one week and the next to help paint a room or fix some plumbing   is it wrong?
106,3,5eaa6370d5ea945196f95250,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-30T23:00:08.892Z,I think it irrational for the women to be asking the man to do things
106,3,5eaa6370d5ea945196f95250,inquisitiveZebra,2020-04-30T23:00:58.259Z,But the man has the right to be annoyed by her request because it became a constant request from the women

106,3,5d43364cce0995585f1a5cbd,excitedMonkey,2020-04-30T23:01:01.451Z,Would it be more rational if it was a man asking another man to do things?
106,3,5d482ea221c9be351f761dac,novelBear,2020-04-30T23:01:04.504Z,I think the daughter should be trying to help her mother. It is HER mother after all. That way the husband could be relieved.
106,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762296,livelyCamel,2020-04-30T23:01:11.714Z,"brightHippo I don't think so. However, if someone asked you to help every week for multiple days then I consider that asking too much."
106,3,5d482ea421c9be351f762296,livelyCamel,2020-04-30T23:01:44.870Z,novelBear I agree. She could take on some of the burden and also get lessons for her parents
106,3,5d43364cce0995585f1a5cbd,excitedMonkey,2020-04-30T23:02:56.347Z,"However the woman is more busy than her husband, so I think the husband could still help out a little."
106,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762956,brightHippo,2020-04-30T23:03:03.320Z,Maybe he could offer to help with things at certain times  if he is busier than the story lead on.
106,3,5d482ea221c9be351f761dac,novelBear,2020-04-30T23:03:31.975Z,"However, I do not think that asking this of her husband makes her the a-hole."
106,3,5d43364cce0995585f1a5cbd,excitedMonkey,2020-04-30T23:03:38.953Z,I agree.

106,3,5d482ea621c9be351f762956,brightHippo,2020-04-30T23:04:05.062Z,no
107,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76278a,curiousCamel,2020-05-01T18:29:31.400Z,"So I think my major issue with the guy is that he is thinking of his own concerns and how it annoys him, rather than thinking of his mother in law"
107,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76227f,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T18:29:38.111Z,I think this guy is the asshole. He was rude to his mother n law.

107,1,5d482ea321c9be351f76213d,delightedBison,2020-05-01T18:29:44.513Z,My initial impression is I don't think it was his place to say something like that to his mother in-law. 
107,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fc3,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T18:29:54.297Z,I believe this person is being very rude to his mother'

107,1,5d482ea321c9be351f76213d,delightedBison,2020-05-01T18:30:13.778Z,I think he should have talked to his spouse about this and see what she would have thought
107,1,5eac601cd5ea945196fa0766,lightElephant,2020-05-01T18:30:25.351Z,I think it was okay to tell her he is frustrated because he is trying to help her

107,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ec,inspiredBear,2020-05-01T18:30:34.259Z,"I think that if he really wanted her to learn English so badly, he could actually help her."

107,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76227f,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T18:30:51.498Z,Just having the attitude of I learned Spanish you can learn English is very arrogant. 
107,1,5d482ea321c9be351f76213d,delightedBison,2020-05-01T18:30:54.867Z,I think he should have offerred to help her learn.
107,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ec,inspiredBear,2020-05-01T18:31:01.593Z,"Also, he deminishes her learning English by comparing her language acquisition with his. Just because he can pick up languages faster doesn't mean everyone can."
107,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fc3,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T18:31:01.912Z,The guy does not know how dificult is to older people to learn a new lenguage

107,1,5eac601cd5ea945196fa0766,lightElephant,2020-05-01T18:31:23.216Z,Eight years is a long time to be in a country and not learn the language
107,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76278a,curiousCamel,2020-05-01T18:31:31.131Z,"Exactly, he's had that privilege and didn't even try to see her perspective."
107,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ec,inspiredBear,2020-05-01T18:31:32.334Z,Agreed. He should have been nicer about it. 
107,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76227f,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T18:31:33.271Z,"For one, it's easier for younger people to learn languages than older individuals. Which Eager eagerHorse pointed out as I have been typing. "
107,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fc3,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T18:31:34.196Z,I can tell he has some racist side in him
107,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7621a1,excitedGiraffe,2020-05-01T18:31:37.945Z,the older thing is a cop-out. 
107,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ec,inspiredBear,2020-05-01T18:31:46.821Z,"I can't say whether or not he is racist or anything, but he does come off as aggressive."
107,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7621a1,excitedGiraffe,2020-05-01T18:32:04.747Z,agreed he's aggressive in his language 
107,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76278a,curiousCamel,2020-05-01T18:32:05.715Z,"I agree eight years is a logn time, so its about time he helps her out, rather than beign rude about it"
107,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76227f,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T18:32:06.859Z,I think his little paragraph at the end was phoney and added after he was roasted on Reddit. 
107,1,5eac601cd5ea945196fa0766,lightElephant,2020-05-01T18:32:09.446Z,"I don’t think he was rude, just honest"
107,1,5d482ea321c9be351f76213d,delightedBison,2020-05-01T18:32:10.621Z,"Overall I think his behavior came across as aggressive, even in his clarification he was kind of rude"
107,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ec,inspiredBear,2020-05-01T18:32:18.503Z,I also think his add on at the end was phony.
107,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fc3,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T18:32:18.623Z,Does he know what kind of education his mother -in- law had as a kid?
107,1,5d482ea321c9be351f76213d,delightedBison,2020-05-01T18:32:32.205Z,I think there is a way to be honest but respectful
107,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76227f,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T18:32:41.452Z,"I also feel it is important that people are allowed to preserve their culture, no matter where they live. "
107,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76278a,curiousCamel,2020-05-01T18:32:49.077Z,"Exactly, I agree that his clarification just didn't seem realistic"
107,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ec,inspiredBear,2020-05-01T18:32:51.163Z,"Agreed, you can say how you feel without belittling someone else. "
107,1,5eac601cd5ea945196fa0766,lightElephant,2020-05-01T18:33:06.082Z,I feel he is just trying to motivate her to learn
107,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76227f,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T18:33:07.279Z,eagerHorse another good point. Education makes all the difference. 
107,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76227f,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T18:33:37.457Z,"I don't think he's trying to motivate her, I think he has selfish motivations. "
107,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7621a1,excitedGiraffe,2020-05-01T18:33:39.363Z,yes - that's why he should have offered to help her learn
107,1,5d482ea321c9be351f76213d,delightedBison,2020-05-01T18:33:40.448Z,"Also, DuoLingo is only useful if she 1) has a phone or something that can house the app and 2) can learn from it. Some people dont learn well from online"

107,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fc3,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T18:34:04.135Z,Some imigrants came to the USA from a very poor background and barely finish elementary school
107,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76278a,curiousCamel,2020-05-01T18:34:36.293Z,"Saying that he hates her calling for help shows that his intent for her learnign English isn't about her own good or general indepedence, but rather he wants  her to learn English for his own benefits."
107,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ec,inspiredBear,2020-05-01T18:34:49.085Z,"In conclusion, I do think he was the asshole."
107,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763fc3,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T18:35:29.048Z,I believe he was the asshole.
107,1,5d482ea621c9be351f76278a,curiousCamel,2020-05-01T18:35:34.978Z,Agrred
107,3,5d482ea421c9be351f76227f,inspiredMonkey,2020-05-01T18:58:58.182Z,This one was tough because I think they are both being assholes. 
107,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76278a,livelyDolphin,2020-05-01T18:59:00.799Z,SO my first thought are that she is not the asshole
107,3,5d482ea321c9be351f76213d,lightGorilla,2020-05-01T18:59:05.680Z,I dont think she was the asshole but i do think she should have asked if her husband was okay with helping
107,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7621a1,brightGiraffe,2020-05-01T18:59:37.866Z,She cant take time for her mom because she's in school? how often is she calling?
107,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76278a,livelyDolphin,2020-05-01T18:59:39.381Z,"Yeah I feel like they should both be helping, even if she is busy, it is her mom. Yet, he needs to be moe supportive."
107,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ec,delightedElephant,2020-05-01T18:59:41.304Z,I think she is the asshole but only because she is expecting her husband to help translate when she didn't ask or communicate with him about it. 
107,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7621a1,brightGiraffe,2020-05-01T18:59:48.312Z,lack of context is hard ehre
107,3,5eac601cd5ea945196fa0766,excitedBison,2020-05-01T18:59:57.014Z,I think he should try to help her but also assist her in learning the language herself.
107,3,5d482ea421c9be351f76227f,inspiredMonkey,2020-05-01T19:00:08.236Z,"I know that graduate school is very demanding, but I did have 10 free minutes while working on my Masters, so I don't understand why they couldn't take the call themselves. "
107,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7621a1,brightGiraffe,2020-05-01T19:00:17.434Z,Her mom DOES need to learn the language
107,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763fc3,curiousZebra,2020-05-01T19:00:19.747Z,"This is  a hard one, but the husband could have been more patient and help heis in laws"
107,3,5d482ea321c9be351f76213d,lightGorilla,2020-05-01T19:00:30.696Z,"I don't think she was deliberately trying to be rude, just came off that way. Graduate school is a lot of work but I still have time to help my family"
107,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7621a1,brightGiraffe,2020-05-01T19:00:34.784Z,this one sounds like the wife of the first one BTW
107,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76278a,livelyDolphin,2020-05-01T19:00:36.281Z,"I think more contxt is necessary to fully understand. Are these calls hour long, daily phone calls? Or short questions? I think that makes a difference"
107,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763fc3,curiousZebra,2020-05-01T19:00:40.926Z,He has more free time that her and he is bi-lingual

107,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ec,delightedElephant,2020-05-01T19:00:57.853Z,I agree with livelyDolphin in that we need more context.
107,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7621a1,brightGiraffe,2020-05-01T19:01:10.830Z,ahh it's a cop out. if I moved to Germany I would learn German.
107,3,5d482ea421c9be351f76227f,inspiredMonkey,2020-05-01T19:01:17.066Z,"curiousZebra that is true, but he doesn't have to be rude and tell the mother n law to learn the language"
107,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7621a1,brightGiraffe,2020-05-01T19:01:18.966Z,it's a respect thing to where you live 
107,3,5d482ea321c9be351f76213d,lightGorilla,2020-05-01T19:01:19.023Z,I think they both need more compassion and better communication. It is really hard to say though. 
107,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7621a1,brightGiraffe,2020-05-01T19:01:20.655Z,period
107,3,5d482ea421c9be351f76227f,inspiredMonkey,2020-05-01T19:01:26.951Z,"you think would, but you'd find it tough. period. "
107,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ec,delightedElephant,2020-05-01T19:01:37.881Z,"I would also learn a language of a country I was moving to, but the United States doesn't have an official language so it's not the same comparison."
107,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763fc3,curiousZebra,2020-05-01T19:01:40.416Z,But the wife could stop being so defensive about her husband suggestions on how her parents should try to learn English
107,3,5eac601cd5ea945196fa0766,excitedBison,2020-05-01T19:01:47.696Z,It would be of great benefit to her to learn English.  He can help her find resources to accomplish that.
107,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76278a,livelyDolphin,2020-05-01T19:01:55.846Z,I find this one really hard
107,3,5d482ea421c9be351f76227f,inspiredMonkey,2020-05-01T19:01:58.186Z,it's very culturally disrespectful to d demand someone learn  a language. 
107,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76278a,livelyDolphin,2020-05-01T19:02:09.784Z,agreed inspiredMonkey

107,3,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ec,delightedElephant,2020-05-01T19:03:03.483Z,"When she says ""So when my mom calls for translation-related stuff, I pass it onto my husband"" she's implying that she doesn't take any calls anymore."

107,3,5d482ea421c9be351f76227f,inspiredMonkey,2020-05-01T19:03:15.717Z,the spouse is being an asshole by trying to shrug the duties off by insisting the mother n law learns english. 
107,3,5d482ea421c9be351f7621a1,brightGiraffe,2020-05-01T19:03:17.758Z,"how many Poles, Germans, etc uneducated peopled moved here and learned English"
107,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763fc3,curiousZebra,2020-05-01T19:03:17.957Z,The husband should help because she is trying to her her master degree
107,3,5d482ea321c9be351f76213d,lightGorilla,2020-05-01T19:03:23.746Z,"It is also hard because America is different in that we have a lot of cultures and languages here. So moving to one country may mean needing to learn a language, but here, theoretically, you could get by"
107,3,5d482ea621c9be351f76278a,livelyDolphin,2020-05-01T19:03:32.352Z,If she was taking all the calls and he still thought these things I dont think she would be the asshole

108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,novelElephant,2020-05-01T18:21:51.129Z,"I think it really depends on how often it is, which we don't know, but if it really is only every once in awhile, then I don't think they are the asshole either"
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761de7,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T18:21:58.897Z,"I think the poster is an asshole. While the husband married into the family, it's still her parents, so it's more of her obligation."
108,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,inspiredZebra,2020-05-01T18:22:27.158Z,I believe person is not the asshole and should actually speak to spouse and explain will help parents when is thru with the Master's degree

108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,novelElephant,2020-05-01T18:22:42.584Z,I was thinking of like ... I would expect my husband to be willing to lift / carry / mow the lawn for my mom every once in awhile
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,novelElephant,2020-05-01T18:22:50.146Z,but those are things he is better at / I can't do

108,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,inspiredZebra,2020-05-01T18:23:18.076Z,She can but this will take away from her studying
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,novelElephant,2020-05-01T18:23:20.700Z,"I'm torn and could go either way, tbh,"

108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761de7,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T18:23:58.662Z,I agree about pushing it to her husband.
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,novelElephant,2020-05-01T18:23:59.349Z,"If it's often enough that it actually interferes with her studies, then it's probably too often for the husband to be doing it since it is her parents"
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761f2e,eagerDolphin,2020-05-01T18:24:13.569Z,And how often do they never translation? It might be annoying.
108,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,inspiredZebra,2020-05-01T18:24:16.517Z,Yes husband is right her parents should have learned the language but she is not responsible for what her parent did or didn't do
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,novelElephant,2020-05-01T18:24:21.156Z,I can agree that she is the asshole
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761f2e,eagerDolphin,2020-05-01T18:24:29.339Z,I don’t think the husband is an asshole
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-05-01T18:24:32.539Z,"i guess she is the asshole, considering its her family and he is uncomfrotable with it"
108,0,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,fulfilledOtter,2020-05-01T18:24:36.446Z,"If she expected her husband to learn, she can then expect to help her parents learn too"
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761de7,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T18:24:40.709Z,"Yes, she's definitely the asshole in my book."
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,novelElephant,2020-05-01T18:24:42.231Z,yeah that's true
108,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,inspiredZebra,2020-05-01T18:24:45.899Z,yes I did 
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761de7,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T18:24:48.262Z,"Yes, I agree."
108,0,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,fulfilledOtter,2020-05-01T18:25:00.787Z,Yes I agree too.
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761f2e,eagerDolphin,2020-05-01T18:25:08.345Z,I agree
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-05-01T18:25:13.346Z,"i think i would say she is the asshole, but only because there is no grey area to choose. "
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,novelElephant,2020-05-01T18:25:19.029Z,"yeah, agreed"
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761de7,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T18:25:22.775Z,"Yeah, agreed."
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,novelElephant,2020-05-01T18:25:24.933Z,since we can't get more information / details
108,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,inspiredZebra,2020-05-01T18:25:33.182Z,yes I agree as well
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,novelElephant,2020-05-01T18:26:09.329Z,So the poster is the asshole 
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-05-01T18:26:16.503Z,yes
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761de7,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T18:26:18.024Z,"Yes, my vote is she's the asshole."
108,0,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,fulfilledOtter,2020-05-01T18:26:19.946Z,"Yes, poster is indeed the asshole."
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-05-01T18:26:34.505Z,all vote for poster being the asshole say yes or aye
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-05-01T18:26:38.990Z,if not say no
108,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,inspiredZebra,2020-05-01T18:26:39.006Z,Only because there is no grey area
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761de7,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T18:26:47.851Z,Yes.
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-05-01T18:27:14.552Z,yes
108,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,inspiredZebra,2020-05-01T18:27:18.285Z,Well I think she could translate for her parents when and if she has the time
108,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,inspiredZebra,2020-05-01T18:27:33.544Z,This person is the asshole
108,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,novelElephant,2020-05-01T18:27:35.551Z,Yep 
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,curiousBear,2020-05-01T18:36:31.544Z,"not the asshole, its not rude to ask someone to learn the language when they count on you for everything. if he approached it nicely, then i think its okay and hes not the asshole"
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,livelyBison,2020-05-01T18:36:33.883Z,"Even though this person comes off really abrasive and harsh, I think he's just blowing off steam in the post, but was actually polite to his in-laws"
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,livelyBison,2020-05-01T18:36:36.833Z,so not the asshole
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,livelyBison,2020-05-01T18:36:54.019Z,I wouldn't want my in-laws calling several times a day about ANYTHING much less something that's basically work
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761de7,excitedZebra,2020-05-01T18:36:54.134Z,"This one is kind of hard to be honest. In some ways, he's an asshole. In another way, I see his point. Just not sure it should come from him."
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:36:57.377Z,He's the asshole.
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,livelyBison,2020-05-01T18:37:16.962Z,Would you want to help your in-laws with something mentally taxing several times a day?
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:37:21.003Z,He said she calls only when she can't get a hold of other family members. This is also avoiding her educational level.
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,curiousBear,2020-05-01T18:37:24.599Z,being needed for constant translation for someone that wont learn a bit of english to get by is hard. he offered many ways to help her learn english
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:37:25.118Z,He said sometimes.
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:37:28.982Z,He didn't say constantly.
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,curiousBear,2020-05-01T18:37:43.409Z,"true, i shouldnt have used constantly"
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761de7,excitedZebra,2020-05-01T18:37:44.227Z,He was polite to his inlaws about it. I just wonder if the message should have come from his wife first though.
108,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,novelGorilla,2020-05-01T18:37:46.610Z,I don't believe the poster is the AH because he didn't say it rudely when he said that to his mother in law. I believe some people just get used to having someone else do the translating for them. She should try to be indeoendent
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,livelyBison,2020-05-01T18:37:51.699Z,"I guess he said ""random times"" "
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,livelyBison,2020-05-01T18:37:52.617Z,still
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,livelyBison,2020-05-01T18:37:54.590Z,that would be annoying
108,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,novelGorilla,2020-05-01T18:38:10.904Z,Yes. What if he is at work?
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:38:17.393Z,He wasn't polite. Reminding someone how long they've been here to justify criticizing their lack of language skills isn't nice
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:38:33.719Z,"Again, he said she calls him sometimes when she can't reach any other family first. He's a last resort call"
108,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,novelGorilla,2020-05-01T18:38:35.581Z,That could be really annoying and would cut in to his schedule
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:38:38.089Z,How often would that be happening?
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761de7,excitedZebra,2020-05-01T18:38:40.174Z,I agree it would be annoying though.
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,curiousBear,2020-05-01T18:38:51.741Z,"i understand why someone would get offended by being asked to learn english. but if you depend on other people to get things done, its not that crazy to be asked to learn some english"
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761de7,excitedZebra,2020-05-01T18:38:54.605Z,"But if he wasn't around, what would she do then?"
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,curiousBear,2020-05-01T18:38:57.156Z,i dont think he is an asshole
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,livelyBison,2020-05-01T18:39:06.977Z,I think he probably just said about how long she's been here since it would be different if she JUST moved here
108,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,novelGorilla,2020-05-01T18:39:10.679Z,But he even offered to help her on the way
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,livelyBison,2020-05-01T18:39:12.232Z,whereas at this point it looks like she's just too lazy to try
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:39:13.364Z,"Again, we don't know her educational level. She may not even be able to read duolingo"
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,livelyBison,2020-05-01T18:39:21.556Z,and so just relies on others all the time
108,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,novelGorilla,2020-05-01T18:39:37.495Z,True
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:39:37.597Z,I live in California. It's not laziness. There are a lot of people who speak Spanish in professional settings.
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,curiousBear,2020-05-01T18:39:41.691Z,"he offered to help her find ways to learn, he is stressed out from having to help. i believe he is not the asshole"
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761de7,excitedZebra,2020-05-01T18:39:42.292Z,"Yes, he did offer to help. So he's not an asshole in my book. It would be one thing to say that she should learn English and left it at that. But he didn't."
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:39:54.420Z,He's the asshole.
108,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,novelGorilla,2020-05-01T18:40:06.809Z,"No, I don't think so"
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:40:11.577Z,"If I get a call from my in laws sometimes to help them, I'm not going to get upset and demand they learn."
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,curiousBear,2020-05-01T18:40:22.641Z,it is obvoiusly not sometimes that hes being called
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,livelyBison,2020-05-01T18:40:24.151Z,I just can't imagine feeling like you have to be available to help translate at any moment
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:40:24.686Z,"It's like with computers and the ederly. My father calls all the time, I'm not going to tell him to go take a class."
108,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,novelGorilla,2020-05-01T18:40:34.061Z,"Well, what if it is everyday?"
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,livelyBison,2020-05-01T18:40:34.818Z,"But it's your father, not your in-law"
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:40:37.099Z,How is it obvious it isn't sometimes?
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,curiousBear,2020-05-01T18:40:39.606Z,were going to have a hung jury
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:40:41.674Z,My mother in law also calls me
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,curiousBear,2020-05-01T18:40:42.909Z,i believe he is not the ashole
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761de7,excitedZebra,2020-05-01T18:40:52.962Z,"No, but the frequency would get annoying. I still don't think he's an asshole."
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,livelyBison,2020-05-01T18:40:56.991Z,"He could have been way meaner about, so I don't think he's the asshole"
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:41:03.464Z,"Again, how are you all so sure of the frequency?"
108,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,novelGorilla,2020-05-01T18:41:04.466Z,I don't either
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,curiousBear,2020-05-01T18:41:17.269Z,he has his reasons to get stressed out and went about it in a fair way
108,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,novelGorilla,2020-05-01T18:41:18.236Z,We aren't sure
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,livelyBison,2020-05-01T18:41:21.013Z,"he says ""at random times of the day"" and his frustration level makes me think it isn't like once a month"
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:41:23.339Z,My wife's mom sometimes calls me when she can't get ahold of other family members asking me to translate 
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:41:26.799Z,That's what he said
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761de7,excitedZebra,2020-05-01T18:41:26.987Z,"No one is sure, but over time, it could get on your nerves."
108,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,novelGorilla,2020-05-01T18:41:46.510Z,Just might be on his time
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:41:51.980Z,Then why isn't he annoyed talking to them in Spanish if he has to generally speak it around them?
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761f32,curiousBear,2020-05-01T18:42:07.391Z,he is not the asshole because he is stressed out and asked them to learn english. he didnt handle it badly. he
108,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,novelGorilla,2020-05-01T18:42:07.401Z,If I was at work wouldn't want to be called
108,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,novelGorilla,2020-05-01T18:42:17.829Z,Even if it is ocassionaly
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,livelyBison,2020-05-01T18:42:18.582Z,I think it's the extra translation work he is being asked to do whenever needed
108,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e09,livelyBison,2020-05-01T18:42:28.508Z,I still say not the asshole
108,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,novelGorilla,2020-05-01T18:42:37.479Z,He isn't the asshole
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:42:41.161Z,I think you are relating the two posts
108,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,novelGorilla,2020-05-01T18:42:46.720Z,cuz he even offered to hep
108,1,5d482ea621c9be351f7629de,novelGorilla,2020-05-01T18:42:50.809Z,help
108,1,5d482ea421c9be351f7622df,eagerCamel,2020-05-01T18:42:56.352Z,"He didn't say he was stressed, that he was frustrated and it was annoying"
109,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761ea0,openCamel,2020-05-01T18:57:26.950Z,I think this is a tougher one. OP probably genuinely feels left out of conversation. Her son and partner are probably used to communicating in French and didn't think about it. 
109,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761ea0,openCamel,2020-05-01T18:57:39.752Z,I think their reaction is more assholish than OPs though. 
109,2,5d420c68ce0995585f1a548f,inspiredZebra,2020-05-01T18:57:56.872Z,I think this person is an asshole. There is nothing wrong with communicating in your language.
109,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761c6c,fulfilledBear,2020-05-01T18:58:01.489Z,They are living in her home. If they want to have a private conversation they should go in a separate room. It’s disrespectful for them to not consider her. If it wasn’t a big deal they could have finished it in English 
109,2,5d482ea521c9be351f762434,curiousElephant,2020-05-01T18:58:09.686Z,"I have been in similar situations. I know that I do not like it when people who know another language and English, choose to speak the one that they know I do not understand."
109,2,5d420c68ce0995585f1a548f,inspiredZebra,2020-05-01T18:58:38.362Z,"I guarantee if any of you were in a different country around an english speaker, you would choose to use english."

109,2,5d482ea321c9be351f76212b,lightDolphin,2020-05-01T18:58:47.480Z,I think this person is an asshole because they are expecting to be a part of every conversation. The two are used to speaking in French.
109,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761ea0,openCamel,2020-05-01T18:58:58.953Z,I think because they are a guest of her home they should be more cognizant of speaking so she can understand. 
109,2,5d420c68ce0995585f1a548f,inspiredZebra,2020-05-01T18:59:29.529Z,It is her son who has come to visit with his partner. He is speaking to his partner.

109,2,5d420c68ce0995585f1a548f,inspiredZebra,2020-05-01T19:00:27.737Z,Why is it necessary that she understand? Even if the conversation does not include her?

109,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761c6c,fulfilledBear,2020-05-01T19:01:09.483Z,Like they are talking about us in that situation 
109,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761ea0,openCamel,2020-05-01T19:01:18.636Z,Agree with curiousElephant

109,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761ea0,openCamel,2020-05-01T19:02:02.831Z,He was with all of them
109,2,5d420c68ce0995585f1a548f,inspiredZebra,2020-05-01T19:02:14.069Z,"Yeah, but he and his boyfriend were speaking."

109,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761ea0,openCamel,2020-05-01T19:02:59.357Z,I agree with that. 
109,2,5d420c68ce0995585f1a548f,inspiredZebra,2020-05-01T19:03:14.518Z,There's no reason why someone should be forced to make someone else feel comfortable. She understood that he was a french man who's first language is french. He was not rude.
109,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761c6c,fulfilledBear,2020-05-01T19:03:16.528Z,They were not being considerate of all parties . Mom is not the asshole. Boyfriend was the asshole for leaving the room. 
109,2,5d482ea321c9be351f76212b,lightDolphin,2020-05-01T19:03:32.143Z,I can agree with that.
109,3,5d482ea121c9be351f761c6c,excitedZebra,2020-05-01T19:12:29.873Z,I think that the husband should be trying harder to get to know the mother 
109,3,5d482ea221c9be351f761ea0,inquisitiveOtter,2020-05-01T19:12:36.125Z,"I think OP is the AH, but very slightly. He could have let his mom know that his partner is shy about his english speaking and that is why they prefer to use German together."
109,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762434,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T19:12:46.920Z,"I think that he was being unfair to his mom. She rarely gets to see him. Although I understand he son's husband is not comfortable with is English, it's not an excuse to make his mother feel so badly."
109,3,5d482ea221c9be351f761ea0,inquisitiveOtter,2020-05-01T19:12:55.785Z,I agree curiousHorse
109,3,5d420c68ce0995585f1a548f,openHippo,2020-05-01T19:13:07.776Z,"I also feel like the mother is being dramatic, she is not incapable of 'catching-up' with her son. He can still speak english."
109,3,5d482ea321c9be351f76212b,lightCamel,2020-05-01T19:13:15.151Z,This one was a bit difficult but I don't think the son was an asshole. The son and mother should try to understand each other's views and not put the son in the middle.
109,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762434,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T19:13:31.921Z,at the very least he could have done a 50 50 split of German and English and TRANSLATED for his pained mom so she felt included. That is what I would have done. 
109,3,5d482ea321c9be351f76212b,lightCamel,2020-05-01T19:13:40.594Z,I agree with openHippo

109,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762434,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T19:14:20.025Z,I think her son could have handled that a lot better. 
109,3,5d482ea121c9be351f761c6c,excitedZebra,2020-05-01T19:14:24.568Z,The son didn’t try to forge a bridge 
109,3,5d482ea221c9be351f761ea0,inquisitiveOtter,2020-05-01T19:14:35.650Z,Yes excitedZebra
109,3,5d482ea221c9be351f761ea0,inquisitiveOtter,2020-05-01T19:14:47.244Z,Son could have handled it better for sure. 
109,3,5d482ea321c9be351f76212b,lightCamel,2020-05-01T19:14:47.558Z,That's fair.
109,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762434,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T19:15:11.568Z,Everyone could have given a little. Her son could have spoke english 50% of the time and german 50%. this would also help his husband learn to be more comfortable.
109,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762434,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T19:15:26.671Z,the husband should have tried speaking english too sometimes.
109,3,5d482ea221c9be351f761ea0,inquisitiveOtter,2020-05-01T19:15:28.008Z,And maybe mom would learn some German. 
109,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762434,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T19:15:57.929Z,yeah and mom could learn some german too. it could have been a lot more inclusive for all if everyone gave a little
109,3,5d482ea221c9be351f761ea0,inquisitiveOtter,2020-05-01T19:15:59.054Z,I think being shy about speaking a 2nd language coupled with probably being nervous to be at your in-laws house deepens this issue a bit. 
109,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762434,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T19:16:20.642Z,instead the son didn;t care as much about his mom's feelings as he did his husbands. sad.
109,3,5d482ea221c9be351f761ea0,inquisitiveOtter,2020-05-01T19:16:27.545Z,"I think OP is probably trying to help his husband through his language insecurities and make him feel comfortable, but then caused this problem. "

109,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762434,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T19:16:48.877Z,they all could have done better for each other and learned something
109,3,5d420c68ce0995585f1a548f,openHippo,2020-05-01T19:17:00.167Z,Yeah
109,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762434,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T19:17:01.064Z,instead the son just decided his mom's feelings were not as important.
109,3,5d482ea321c9be351f76212b,lightCamel,2020-05-01T19:17:17.604Z,I think everyone is a bit of an asshole here pretty equally.
109,3,5d482ea221c9be351f761ea0,inquisitiveOtter,2020-05-01T19:17:34.819Z,On reddit i think it might be an ESH- everybody sucks here.

109,3,5d420c68ce0995585f1a548f,openHippo,2020-05-01T19:17:47.393Z,I don't think it was completely assholish.

109,3,5d482ea321c9be351f76212b,lightCamel,2020-05-01T19:18:07.001Z,"The mom and SIL could have each made more of an effort to communicate, and the son could have done better connecting the two to make them both feel more comfrotable."
109,3,5d482ea521c9be351f762434,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T19:18:30.651Z,yeah I agree with light lightCamel 
109,3,5d420c68ce0995585f1a548f,openHippo,2020-05-01T19:18:36.796Z,I think the mother was completely still capable of bonding with her son at the end of the day.
109,3,5d482ea221c9be351f761ea0,inquisitiveOtter,2020-05-01T19:18:39.947Z,Right. I think someone mentioned building bridges.

I have a situation very similar to this story my Mil  is from Mexico and has been here for 29 years and still speaks very broken English. The way he went about it was very white privilege speaking.

110,0,5d2a2256d9ca6e7f1bedb4d3,openCamel,2020-05-01T18:54:10.961Z,He could have approached her in a different way. He was annoyed by her constant demands. He does seem kind of like the asshole. Although I feel the mother in law and rest of family are overreacting.
110,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761e64,delightedElephant,2020-05-01T18:54:35.435Z,My conclusion is that he is an asshole and he needs to be more understanding of her situation
110,0,5d482ea121c9be351f761c97,fulfilledHorse,2020-05-01T18:54:48.447Z,Ok it looks like we agree he's the asshole.  except for novelMonkey talking about the wrong scenario.
110,0,5d2a2256d9ca6e7f1bedb4d3,openCamel,2020-05-01T18:55:17.843Z,I conclude he is the asshole and should be more sensitive to older peoples needs.
110,0,5d482ea121c9be351f761c97,fulfilledHorse,2020-05-01T18:55:30.146Z,he should find a better way to deal with the issue that isn't offensive
110,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761e64,livelyBear,2020-05-01T19:18:59.192Z,Hearing it from this side of the story makes me realize both of them are being unrealistic and their expectations for one another
110,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761e64,livelyBear,2020-05-01T19:19:18.203Z,I get it she just wants to help out her mom although it’s not her husband’s responsibility to make sure she’s OK in the sense of translation

110,2,5d2a2256d9ca6e7f1bedb4d3,fulfilledElephant,2020-05-01T19:19:47.052Z,She should have asked her husband if it was ok for him to translate. Regardless she is not the asshole 
110,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761c97,openGiraffe,2020-05-01T19:19:54.101Z,They should both be helping her mom.

110,2,5eac671ad5ea945196fa0d03,lightZebra,2020-05-01T19:21:55.813Z,she should equally help her mother to solve the translation not pushing to her husband always. or better still pay for a class for the mother  
110,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7636a3,inquisitiveBison,2020-05-01T19:22:03.198Z,She says her parents have been trying to make it in the USA their whole lives. I don't think it's unreasonable for the husband to expect them to learn English in such a long amount of time.
110,2,5eac671ad5ea945196fa0d03,lightZebra,2020-05-01T19:22:13.727Z,the man is not an asshole 
110,2,5d2a2256d9ca6e7f1bedb4d3,fulfilledElephant,2020-05-01T19:22:26.246Z,They both need a better system for mom. She just assumed stepping up for family was what everyone did. 
110,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761c97,openGiraffe,2020-05-01T19:23:06.357Z,Right fulfilledElephant -- they should be working together to fix this problem instead of asking strangers on the internet who the bigger asshole is.
110,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7636a3,inquisitiveBison,2020-05-01T19:23:35.153Z,"Conclusion: I agree with fulfilledElephant I'll call her an asshole for the sake of this task in the sense she isn't respecting her husband's boundaries, but they could stand to have a better system than the arguments they go through now."

110,2,5d2a2256d9ca6e7f1bedb4d3,fulfilledElephant,2020-05-01T19:24:45.110Z,I conclude the wife is the asshole
111,2,5eac69b8d5ea945196fa1146,openHippo,2020-05-01T19:30:00.170Z,my impression is that the husband is the real asshole in the story
111,2,5d1a795a2d54e95acef0ea74,delightedDolphin,2020-05-01T19:30:01.736Z,I think her husband shouldn't complain about translating for her parents. I don't think she is being an asshole at all. I think that he should help since he is a part of her family now.

116,2,5eac5a0ed5ea945196fa0712,inspiredElephant,2020-05-02T00:02:46.516Z,Yes brightHorse you are right
116,2,5eac5a0ed5ea945196fa0712,inspiredElephant,2020-05-02T00:03:11.756Z,moreover he is in his house
116,2,5eacaa9ad5ea945196fa63ef,eagerBison,2020-05-02T00:03:11.950Z,I think they could have picked a  better way to put it
116,2,5eaca02cd5ea945196fa6060,brightHorse,2020-05-02T00:03:23.414Z,I agree eagerBison 
116,2,5eab4af6d5ea945196f96c0d,curiousCamel,2020-05-02T00:03:42.313Z,I also agreed
116,2,5eacaa9ad5ea945196fa63ef,eagerBison,2020-05-02T00:03:53.165Z,"I agree it sucks to be left out of a conversation like that, but there could have been a better way to put it."
116,2,5eac77e6d5ea945196fa40a3,novelOtter,2020-05-02T00:03:59.237Z,"Yes, I agree. If they wanted her to be involved, they sure would have spoke in English."
116,2,5eaca02cd5ea945196fa6060,brightHorse,2020-05-02T00:04:05.150Z,"I think they could have phrased it a bit better, but I don't think it necessarily makes them an 'asshole'."
116,2,5eacaa9ad5ea945196fa63ef,eagerBison,2020-05-02T00:04:12.084Z,"like novelOtter said, it could have just been a personal conversation"
116,2,5eaca02cd5ea945196fa6060,brightHorse,2020-05-02T00:04:49.283Z,"that is true, theres nothing wrong with a personal conversation. "
116,2,5eac5a0ed5ea945196fa0712,inspiredElephant,2020-05-02T00:05:15.361Z,but its painful to be left out
116,2,5eacaa9ad5ea945196fa63ef,eagerBison,2020-05-02T00:05:15.375Z,I agree. Its a sticky situation haha
116,2,5eac5a0ed5ea945196fa0712,inspiredElephant,2020-05-02T00:05:21.467Z,it hurts
116,2,5eab4af6d5ea945196f96c0d,curiousCamel,2020-05-02T00:05:41.192Z,"Yes,there's nothing fault,but it hurts slightly"
116,2,5eac5a0ed5ea945196fa0712,inspiredElephant,2020-05-02T00:05:41.681Z,and to make it up you dont know what was said
116,2,5eaca02cd5ea945196fa6060,brightHorse,2020-05-02T00:06:00.531Z,"I think they could have possibly waited until they were alone to talk about whatever it was, if they didn't want the mom to hear"
116,2,5eacaa9ad5ea945196fa63ef,eagerBison,2020-05-02T00:06:16.425Z,"That's true also, a very good point."
116,2,5eac77e6d5ea945196fa40a3,novelOtter,2020-05-02T00:06:42.375Z,brightHorse that's true though.
116,3,5eaca02cd5ea945196fa6060,livelyBison,2020-05-02T00:16:25.611Z,"I think the son was the 'asshole'. He was staying with his mom, and easily could have included her."
116,3,5eaca02cd5ea945196fa6060,livelyBison,2020-05-02T00:16:43.818Z,"It was just 2 days that he would feel slightly uncomfortable, and then he could go back to speaking German with his partner as normal."
116,3,5eac77e6d5ea945196fa40a3,inspiredHorse,2020-05-02T00:17:18.222Z,They should have such conversation privately.
116,3,5eaca02cd5ea945196fa6060,livelyBison,2020-05-02T00:17:42.238Z,I agree inspiredHorse 
116,3,5eacaa9ad5ea945196fa63ef,fulfilledHippo,2020-05-02T00:17:50.564Z,I think they were stuck between a rock and a hard place
116,3,5eac5a0ed5ea945196fa0712,curiousElephant,2020-05-02T00:17:57.220Z,I this the son was not an ass hole he was only trying to please both parties
116,3,5eac77e6d5ea945196fa40a3,inspiredHorse,2020-05-02T00:18:05.206Z,"The mother should be carried along,she shouldn't feel left out."
116,3,5eaca02cd5ea945196fa6060,livelyBison,2020-05-02T00:18:19.828Z,The mother invited both the son and his partner into her home. she should be included 
116,3,5eacaa9ad5ea945196fa63ef,fulfilledHippo,2020-05-02T00:18:25.847Z,"however, the partner should have just sucked it up with his bad english and tried to be inclusive. "
116,3,5eaca02cd5ea945196fa6060,livelyBison,2020-05-02T00:18:37.962Z,they can hold private conversations at any other time in german 
116,3,5eacaa9ad5ea945196fa63ef,fulfilledHippo,2020-05-02T00:18:45.438Z,Its not like anyone would make fun of him for bad english
116,3,5eab4af6d5ea945196f96c0d,lightGiraffe,2020-05-02T00:19:09.053Z,The mother got tension because of foreign language
116,3,5eaca02cd5ea945196fa6060,livelyBison,2020-05-02T00:19:23.844Z,"i think the mother's concern is not being included , not the language "
116,3,5eaca02cd5ea945196fa6060,livelyBison,2020-05-02T00:19:34.089Z,the boyfriend can speak english but she cannot speak german with him
116,3,5eac77e6d5ea945196fa40a3,inspiredHorse,2020-05-02T00:20:00.112Z,and its only for a few days.
116,3,5eab4af6d5ea945196f96c0d,lightGiraffe,2020-05-02T00:20:04.776Z,"Yes,good point livelyBison"
116,3,5eacaa9ad5ea945196fa63ef,fulfilledHippo,2020-05-02T00:20:13.107Z,I am saying to the point of the partner saying that they did not speak english because he didnt know the right words. 
116,3,5eac5a0ed5ea945196fa0712,curiousElephant,2020-05-02T00:20:26.717Z,livelyBison nice one
116,3,5eaca02cd5ea945196fa6060,livelyBison,2020-05-02T00:20:35.325Z,thanks
116,3,5eaca02cd5ea945196fa6060,livelyBison,2020-05-02T00:21:44.596Z,i think the mom invited the couple over to get to know them and interact with them
116,3,5eaca02cd5ea945196fa6060,livelyBison,2020-05-02T00:22:02.506Z,i think speaking privately and not including them is rude because she opened her house to them
117,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bf,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T22:46:33.037Z,yes i believe he is a asshole
117,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7638d3,brightCamel,2020-05-01T22:47:00.835Z,same
117,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ab,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T22:47:07.768Z,"I think he was incredibly naive to approach the problem this way, and he sounds like a defensive asshole in reaction, but I don't think he is one."
117,0,5eac6d78d5ea945196fa1b2a,livelyElephant,2020-05-01T22:47:37.433Z,i believe he is an asshole 
117,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bf,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T22:47:40.190Z,we must all come to the same conclusion
117,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7638d3,brightCamel,2020-05-01T22:47:56.158Z,it was hard to tell from his frustration in writing the post
117,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ab,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T22:48:06.749Z,"Any particular reason, beyond his language and his frustration?"
117,0,5eac6d78d5ea945196fa1b2a,livelyElephant,2020-05-01T22:48:28.069Z,i know but he still a man and has to take up responsibilities
117,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bf,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T22:48:40.602Z,he may not be wrong with what he said but his approach was off ie asshole
117,0,5eac6a76d5ea945196fa12a6,fulfilledOtter,2020-05-01T22:48:53.642Z,this person really ain't an asshole
117,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ab,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T22:49:02.434Z,"He was not using asshole language with the  MIL, though?"
117,0,5eac66ded5ea945196fa0cc2,curiousBison,2020-05-01T22:49:20.634Z,not an asshole
117,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ab,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T22:49:23.846Z,"So, stupid, but not an asshole."
117,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7638d3,brightCamel,2020-05-01T22:49:28.725Z,"depends if his frustration leaked out, wish we had more info "
117,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bf,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T22:49:48.385Z,no he did not use language but he may have said it wrong
117,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7638d3,brightCamel,2020-05-01T22:50:09.421Z,also his intention might have been lost in translation
117,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bf,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T22:50:19.303Z,yes
117,0,5eac6d78d5ea945196fa1b2a,livelyElephant,2020-05-01T22:50:22.002Z,yes
117,0,5eac6a76d5ea945196fa12a6,fulfilledOtter,2020-05-01T22:50:26.563Z,he was frustrated and he had to speak up
117,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ab,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T22:50:30.314Z,"Most definitely lost in translation, especially where family is so importatnat"
117,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bf,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-01T22:51:22.726Z,not the asshole
117,0,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ab,eagerHorse,2020-05-01T22:51:23.130Z,"He made a mistake in how he approached this, but not an asshole"
117,0,5eac6d78d5ea945196fa1b2a,livelyElephant,2020-05-01T22:51:26.993Z,not an asshole
117,0,5eac6a76d5ea945196fa12a6,fulfilledOtter,2020-05-01T22:51:42.324Z,he ain't really an asshole
117,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7638d3,brightCamel,2020-05-01T22:51:49.084Z,yeah
117,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ab,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-05-01T23:15:43.514Z,I think the expectation that he will always take the calls is an asshole thing.
117,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ab,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-05-01T23:16:07.568Z,She knew she would be busy.  Couldn't she introduce them to translation software?
117,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7638d3,excitedBison,2020-05-01T23:16:08.927Z,i think the poster is the asshole for expecting her husband to provide translations on call
117,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bf,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T23:16:10.879Z,okay lets get this together now I don't think she is 
117,2,5eac6a76d5ea945196fa12a6,openBear,2020-05-01T23:16:11.534Z,he is really an asshole complaining about the calls
117,2,5eac6d78d5ea945196fa1b2a,eagerGiraffe,2020-05-01T23:16:34.600Z,i dont think there is anything wrong with him helping out
117,2,5eac6d78d5ea945196fa1b2a,eagerGiraffe,2020-05-01T23:16:50.752Z,he is an asshole for complaining 
117,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ab,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-05-01T23:16:57.321Z,But does he have to be the one always doing the helping?
117,2,5eac6d78d5ea945196fa1b2a,eagerGiraffe,2020-05-01T23:17:14.838Z,what are married partners for 
117,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bf,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T23:17:36.065Z,this is about her she was writing
117,2,5eac6a76d5ea945196fa12a6,openBear,2020-05-01T23:17:45.661Z,there is nothing wrong in giving out some minute of his time and he is married to her
117,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ab,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-05-01T23:17:48.488Z,its the constant expectation of it.  she should have planned ahead
117,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ab,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-05-01T23:18:05.562Z,"help her parents find alternatives, enable them"
117,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7638d3,excitedBison,2020-05-01T23:18:06.102Z,it gets frustrating after a bunch of times though and it sounds like they call him everytime
117,2,5eac6d78d5ea945196fa1b2a,eagerGiraffe,2020-05-01T23:18:09.172Z,i still dont see any thing wrong 
117,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7638d3,excitedBison,2020-05-01T23:18:24.462Z,she doesn't say what he might be doing or what his work situation seem like
117,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ab,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-05-01T23:18:37.003Z,"nothing wrong with them calling, something wrong with her expecting him to always field those calls"
117,2,5eac6d78d5ea945196fa1b2a,eagerGiraffe,2020-05-01T23:19:00.861Z,but she does not have an alternative 
117,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ab,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-05-01T23:19:09.463Z,he probably did understand the culture before he married in
117,2,5eac6a76d5ea945196fa12a6,openBear,2020-05-01T23:19:15.046Z,it wasn't her fault the brides parent grew fond of him
117,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bf,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T23:19:43.845Z,no she is not a asshole
117,2,5eac6d78d5ea945196fa1b2a,eagerGiraffe,2020-05-01T23:19:59.492Z,yes
117,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ab,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-05-01T23:19:59.724Z,"still, she could have anticipated the conflict.  there are always alternatives.  or set limits with them"
117,2,5eac66ded5ea945196fa0cc2,brightElephant,2020-05-01T23:20:06.665Z,There is nothing wrong with them calling him.
117,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ab,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-05-01T23:20:27.823Z,"no, but she expects him to always be on call for them"
117,2,5eac6d78d5ea945196fa1b2a,eagerGiraffe,2020-05-01T23:20:46.100Z,if he was in her shoes 
117,2,5eac66ded5ea945196fa0cc2,brightElephant,2020-05-01T23:20:47.494Z,true
117,2,5eac6d78d5ea945196fa1b2a,eagerGiraffe,2020-05-01T23:20:53.092Z,lets think both sides 
117,2,5eac6a76d5ea945196fa12a6,openBear,2020-05-01T23:20:53.284Z,@curiousHorse: i concur
117,2,5eac66ded5ea945196fa0cc2,brightElephant,2020-05-01T23:20:53.602Z,there was no limits
117,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7638d3,excitedBison,2020-05-01T23:21:07.428Z,i understand that they are family but it can be taxing doing it a lot even if he learned Spanish in school
117,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7632bf,curiousHorse,2020-05-01T23:21:14.700Z,not a asshole
117,2,5eac6a76d5ea945196fa12a6,openBear,2020-05-01T23:21:20.013Z,she ain't an asshole
117,2,5eac6d78d5ea945196fa1b2a,eagerGiraffe,2020-05-01T23:21:28.189Z,not an asshole 
117,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7624ab,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-05-01T23:21:33.382Z,still think she's a bit asshole
117,2,5eac66ded5ea945196fa0cc2,brightElephant,2020-05-01T23:21:52.555Z,I concur
118,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761dd3,delightedCamel,2020-05-02T16:09:43.790Z,"I think the delivery of the message was quite poor - disrespectful, stopping them during talking, etc."
118,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761dd3,delightedCamel,2020-05-02T16:10:37.508Z,I think this person is indeed the asshole. 
118,0,5d482ea521c9be351f76246b,excitedDolphin,2020-05-02T16:10:45.098Z,This feels like an entitlement issue. They feel 'excluded' from someone else's conversation and need to butt in.
118,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761dd3,delightedCamel,2020-05-02T16:11:06.253Z,Agree excitedDolphin
118,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762856,eagerGiraffe,2020-05-02T16:11:15.474Z,I agree. It could be that the French person is not comfortable speaking much because of their accent and this mom just alienated her son's partner
118,0,5d482ea421c9be351f76230b,curiousElephant,2020-05-02T16:11:33.985Z,"The conversation was clearly not about or directed to this person, otherwise they would be speaking in a way she could understand. Her interjection was quite rude."
118,0,5d482ea521c9be351f76246b,excitedDolphin,2020-05-02T16:11:50.450Z,"Yeah, I agree. He might also be shy."
118,0,5d482ea421c9be351f76220c,fulfilledBear,2020-05-02T16:12:18.234Z,I think that's a fair assessment. 
118,0,5d482ea221c9be351f761dd3,delightedCamel,2020-05-02T16:13:24.581Z,Sounds like we all agree.  Does anyone think this person IS NOT an asshole?
118,0,5d482ea421c9be351f76220c,fulfilledBear,2020-05-02T16:13:46.245Z,I think we've reached a consensus.
118,0,5d482ea421c9be351f76230b,curiousElephant,2020-05-02T16:13:59.633Z,Agreed.

118,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761dd3,excitedOtter,2020-05-02T16:24:45.113Z,"I'm torn on this one, but leaning towards No.  On one hand the mother is being a good host.  On the other, he should make his husband feel comfortable..."
118,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762856,lightDolphin,2020-05-02T16:25:27.296Z,"This seems like a case where each side can be seen as the asshole so it is hard to decide. The mom wants to be included in her son's life, which is understandable"
118,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76246b,brightElephant,2020-05-02T16:26:05.510Z,"I have to side with the son in this case. Sure his mother may feel slighted, but he is trying to make his SO feel comfortable and his mother should be respectful of her guests' comfort. If she wants to talk to her son, then she should ask."
118,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76220c,curiousHorse,2020-05-02T16:26:06.078Z,"After reviewing all sides, I think she should be more accommodating to her mom as she rarely sees her. "
118,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76230b,inquisitiveCamel,2020-05-02T16:26:15.277Z,"The poster's rationalization is a bit warped (""choose between including my mother in the conversation or making my husband comfortable""), but the result is understandable. I lean toward not the asshole."
118,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76220c,curiousHorse,2020-05-02T16:26:35.390Z,"If the German-speaking spouse if posing an ultimatum, then he's the asshole here, but it didn't seem the case."
118,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76246b,brightElephant,2020-05-02T16:27:13.089Z,"The husband is just shy about speaking a language that isn't their native tongue. It's understandable he might be nervous about saying the wrong thing, especially in front of his mother-in-law."
118,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76220c,curiousHorse,2020-05-02T16:28:05.269Z,"She should encourage her spouse to speak what English he does know, so that all can communicate. "
118,1,5d482ea621c9be351f762856,lightDolphin,2020-05-02T16:28:15.645Z,"I don't think the son is an asshole for wanting to make his partner comfortable, neither is his mom's desire to catch up with her son. No one is the asshole here really, just in need of a conversation"
118,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761dd3,excitedOtter,2020-05-02T16:28:28.854Z,"If they split time between the US and Germany, then hopefully the situation gets better over time with more exposure to English for the husband."
118,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76230b,inquisitiveCamel,2020-05-02T16:28:57.531Z,Presumably his mother can still use his native language to communicate with him about his life; she need not feel slighted by them speaking German.
118,1,5d482ea521c9be351f76246b,brightElephant,2020-05-02T16:29:25.069Z,"Agree with you lightDolphin neither is the asshole, but there is a breakdown in communication happening. "
118,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76220c,curiousHorse,2020-05-02T16:30:12.568Z,I would say yes.
118,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76220c,curiousHorse,2020-05-02T16:30:44.751Z,"But I digress, because the consensus seems to be no,"
119,1,5eacc390d5ea945196fa7bed,novelOtter,2020-05-02T16:16:01.431Z,"I think she has a right to ask her husband to help, however I don't believe she should always be asking him to help and stop and drop. "
119,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763ddf,openElephant,2020-05-02T16:16:24.930Z,I agree with novelOtter I think she should be a little more appreciative of his time
119,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightCamel,2020-05-02T16:16:36.238Z,she should have taught her parents English.

119,1,5ead904ad5ea945196fa9750,fulfilledZebra,2020-05-02T16:16:38.826Z,It has started to interrupt her husband's time.
119,1,5eacc390d5ea945196fa7bed,novelOtter,2020-05-02T16:16:55.127Z,"I don't think she is considering his side of things and that it might not always be convenient for him to help her parents. However, I don't believe his comments were really very biased as she points out"
119,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e77,brightHippo,2020-05-02T16:16:58.169Z,I agree. I think that it is fair that she asked her husband for help but I dont think that is is his responsibility. 
119,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightCamel,2020-05-02T16:17:08.767Z,Assilation is important.
119,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763ddf,openElephant,2020-05-02T16:17:20.746Z,Also her parents can take advantage of some of the resources to begin to learn English a little better. I think at some point parents should not always rely on their children for help.
119,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightCamel,2020-05-02T16:17:22.801Z,That means learning the language.
119,1,5eacc390d5ea945196fa7bed,novelOtter,2020-05-02T16:17:25.547Z,Agree with brightHippo I think its fine she's asking him to help but not at an all day every day basis
119,1,5ead904ad5ea945196fa9750,fulfilledZebra,2020-05-02T16:17:50.185Z,"Due to her going back to school, she basically shoved all translation tasks over to her husband."
119,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightCamel,2020-05-02T16:17:54.142Z,Listen...her husband speaks SPANISH>
119,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightCamel,2020-05-02T16:18:07.995Z,They should learn english.
119,1,5eacc390d5ea945196fa7bed,novelOtter,2020-05-02T16:18:24.672Z,"I think her parents COULD apply themselves to learn the language and not rely on their daughter forever, but I do think she is being kind by helping them. "
119,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightCamel,2020-05-02T16:18:25.116Z,Husband is right to be irritated.
119,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e77,brightHippo,2020-05-02T16:18:27.857Z,I respect her opinion to be courteous and respectful to her parents and I think that she should continue to do that but I do not think that resonsibility should fall on her husband 
119,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763ddf,openElephant,2020-05-02T16:18:33.629Z,Their success is ultimately tied to her success so if she doesn't have time to do minute tasks like translating then she should be able to communicate that to them.
119,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightCamel,2020-05-02T16:18:47.509Z,"Hear, hear."
119,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightCamel,2020-05-02T16:19:13.559Z,I totally think she is the asshole here.
119,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763ddf,openElephant,2020-05-02T16:19:28.819Z,Her husband also can also work to appreciate the fact that she has assimilated on her own without anyone's help 
119,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763ddf,openElephant,2020-05-02T16:19:39.656Z,meaning family*
119,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightCamel,2020-05-02T16:19:50.129Z,Good for her.
119,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763ddf,openElephant,2020-05-02T16:20:00.916Z,But yes she is the asshole because ultimately it is her problem to deal with not his.
119,1,5ead904ad5ea945196fa9750,fulfilledZebra,2020-05-02T16:20:07.448Z,"She isn't a complete asshole, but she failed to consider how her husband is basically at her parents' beck and call for translation, so that makes her one."
119,1,5eacc390d5ea945196fa7bed,novelOtter,2020-05-02T16:20:15.450Z,"I think we are definitely considering both sides, but do we feel that the husband is being a little insensitive? I don't think he should have to help on the parent's schedule but maybe he could offer to help in general? "
119,1,5eacc390d5ea945196fa7bed,novelOtter,2020-05-02T16:20:17.704Z,Maybe he is just annoyed about the frequency
119,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e77,brightHippo,2020-05-02T16:20:19.626Z,I think that there would be ways around this such as providing her parents with other resources or services which may help them translate without taking up her or her husbands time. 
119,1,5ead904ad5ea945196fa9750,fulfilledZebra,2020-05-02T16:20:24.942Z,"It was fine when he translated a little bit here and there, but translation should be her job mostly."

119,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761e77,brightHippo,2020-05-02T16:21:04.825Z,I also think that they could find boundaries to draw such as how long they will be willing to help at one time
119,1,5eacc390d5ea945196fa7bed,novelOtter,2020-05-02T16:21:07.636Z,Definitely the asshole then

119,1,5ead904ad5ea945196fa9750,fulfilledZebra,2020-05-02T16:21:40.278Z,Asshole for not taking account of how the husband would feel about translating all the time.
119,1,5eacc390d5ea945196fa7bed,novelOtter,2020-05-02T16:21:58.399Z,"Yes and expecting him to stop and drop, not considering his time or feelings. Asshole. "
119,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761e77,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-02T16:30:44.221Z,I think that this person is the asshole because I think there were better ways to handle this situation. 
119,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightHorse,2020-05-02T16:30:54.868Z,This is the last situation replayed. He's right.
119,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightHorse,2020-05-02T16:31:04.541Z,Not an asshole.
119,2,5eacc390d5ea945196fa7bed,openBear,2020-05-02T16:31:07.347Z,"This goes back to the last task's point. I think it is important to note that he did speak in a respectful tone, but overall his point was that he wanted her to be independent and helpful"
119,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ddf,curiousGorilla,2020-05-02T16:31:12.664Z,I think he definitely showed his frustration but it didn't sound like he was disrespectful.
119,2,5d482ea721c9be351f762ede,fulfilledMonkey,2020-05-02T16:31:16.996Z,"Agree, not an asshole if he tactfully presented it"
119,2,5eacc390d5ea945196fa7bed,openBear,2020-05-02T16:31:24.299Z,"I don't think he was the asshole here, if it was politely said"
119,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761e77,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-02T16:31:37.955Z,I think that if this person was frustrated with their MIL calling them for help that there would be better ways to address the situation rather than asking his MIL to stop calling him 
119,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightHorse,2020-05-02T16:31:41.789Z,"Right, his wifes responsible for learning english."
119,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ddf,curiousGorilla,2020-05-02T16:31:50.862Z,I think that it is a cultural barrier. It seems that we are expected be independent the USA.
119,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightHorse,2020-05-02T16:31:54.446Z,Wife's parents.

119,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightHorse,2020-05-02T16:32:39.817Z,"So, not an asshole."
119,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ddf,curiousGorilla,2020-05-02T16:32:42.570Z,I think that the wife is caught between the two cultures which is a part of the assimilation process.
119,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761e77,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-02T16:32:44.555Z,"This is similar to the previous situation in that it should not be his responsibility to address tasks for the family, however I think that there would be ways around this. "
119,2,5eacc390d5ea945196fa7bed,openBear,2020-05-02T16:33:08.464Z,"I think independence is important in any case, any country. I believe that there is not an official language for sure, but if you cannot go anywhere without the help of your kids/someone else, then it is time to do something about it."
119,2,5d482ea221c9be351f761e77,inquisitiveHippo,2020-05-02T16:33:16.346Z,It seems as if the wife should also be involved as well as possibly other members of the family and that not all of the responsibility should fall on one person to help translate
119,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightHorse,2020-05-02T16:33:20.995Z,"Hear, hear."
119,2,5eacc390d5ea945196fa7bed,openBear,2020-05-02T16:33:34.851Z," If you flip the situation and apply it to moving to somewhere else, I would certainly want to know the language where I move. If you move to France and can't buy groceries, you'd eventually need to learn French. "
119,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ddf,curiousGorilla,2020-05-02T16:33:48.980Z,"I agree with inquisitiveHippo It is the wife's responsibility to communicate this issue with her family. He is going to be considered the asshole by her family because he is an in-law, even if it is true."
119,2,5ead904ad5ea945196fa9750,brightDolphin,2020-05-02T16:33:51.843Z,I think the reaction by the family makes him not the asshole.
119,2,5ead904ad5ea945196fa9750,brightDolphin,2020-05-02T16:34:02.100Z,Them calling him racist and stuff
119,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightHorse,2020-05-02T16:34:12.286Z,Agree. Learning the language of the country you leve in is a duty.
119,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ddf,curiousGorilla,2020-05-02T16:34:25.041Z,He needs to work on setting the boundary with his wife and then she needs to set the boundary with her family. It is just wrong how it was all handled.
119,2,5ead904ad5ea945196fa9750,brightDolphin,2020-05-02T16:34:32.618Z,Overall a shitty situation though
119,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ddf,curiousGorilla,2020-05-02T16:34:33.238Z,But at the end of the day he is not the asshole.

119,2,5d482ea921c9be351f763618,lightHorse,2020-05-02T16:35:30.356Z,"Yeah, racist to boot."
119,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ddf,curiousGorilla,2020-05-02T16:36:05.097Z,"Exactly, it is unfortunate that race was brought into it when it was a simple boundary issue."
119,2,5eacc390d5ea945196fa7bed,openBear,2020-05-02T16:36:18.650Z,So he is not the asshole because more or less he was trying to kindly help her parents be more independent.

His husband can speak German but he could speak mostly English to translate and converse with his mother.

121,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7623cd,openHippo,2020-05-02T21:01:00.992Z,The son-in-law was way out of order for the way that he expressed his frustration to his mother-in-law. HE could have simply not answered.

121,1,5d482ea121c9be351f761c53,livelyOtter,2020-05-02T21:01:41.494Z,Can you explain why fulfilledGorilla
121,1,5eadd582d5ea945196fab7fc,lightGiraffe,2020-05-02T21:01:56.031Z,He could have suggested english classes at a differnt time he did not have to do that to her in a time of need
121,1,5eadc90cd5ea945196fab1b7,fulfilledGorilla,2020-05-02T21:02:04.002Z,He gave her sources to learn
121,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76222f,delightedBear,2020-05-02T21:02:05.724Z,Maybe if he had tried to teach her better whe she first came he it would of worked out better .
121,1,5eadd00ad5ea945196fab489,eagerCamel,2020-05-02T21:02:06.684Z,I don't think he was an asshole because he tried to give her many different ways to learn English as well as offered to help her.
121,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7623cd,openHippo,2020-05-02T21:02:27.553Z,fulfilledGorilla do you not feel that the tone in which he used could have been disrespectful?
121,1,5eadc90cd5ea945196fab1b7,fulfilledGorilla,2020-05-02T21:02:34.979Z,And one should learn at least relational language of the country one live in
121,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76222f,delightedBear,2020-05-02T21:02:48.972Z,I think it may have been hard for her to understand it .Maybe she had a hard time learning the English .
121,1,5d482ea521c9be351f7623cd,openHippo,2020-05-02T21:02:57.758Z,Many of times it is not what's being said it could be the underlying tone that even in the way he described it indicate that he is the asshole.
121,1,5eadd582d5ea945196fab7fc,lightGiraffe,2020-05-02T21:03:02.994Z,Yes he offered to help but it was because he felt incoviced by his mother in law he did not suggest it soley for her benifit
121,1,5eadd00ad5ea945196fab489,eagerCamel,2020-05-02T21:03:22.939Z,He added a section at the bottom explaining that he didn't use the language in the main part of the story.

121,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76222f,delightedBear,2020-05-02T21:03:46.694Z,I think theway he talks about it and how it he acts makes him a asshole .
121,1,5eadc90cd5ea945196fab1b7,fulfilledGorilla,2020-05-02T21:03:47.019Z,Its all not always about recism

121,1,5eadc90cd5ea945196fab1b7,fulfilledGorilla,2020-05-02T21:04:15.738Z,She was a family and should not feel offended

121,1,5d482ea121c9be351f761c53,livelyOtter,2020-05-02T21:04:21.145Z,I feel that the mother in law could have reached out to her daughter for assistance and not always relying on her son in law
121,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76222f,delightedBear,2020-05-02T21:04:27.030Z,I think the others should have put thier selves in his shoes and looks to see how it felt .

121,1,5eadd582d5ea945196fab7fc,lightGiraffe,2020-05-02T21:04:55.699Z,I think that he should help his mother in law when she needs help it dose not seem like a major incovience to me

121,1,5d482ea421c9be351f76222f,delightedBear,2020-05-02T21:05:22.670Z,I think maybe the daughter could help her mother to

121,2,5d482ea121c9be351f761c53,delightedDolphin,2020-05-02T21:16:00.208Z,I would say that she is not an asshole because she wants to help her parents

121,2,5d482ea421c9be351f76222f,lightBison,2020-05-02T21:20:11.998Z,Maybe he could call them back and not answer the phone when they call.

121,2,5d482ea521c9be351f7623cd,livelyElephant,2020-05-02T21:21:28.535Z,I think the husband can also take the initiative and buy her the software and only take calls when he feels like doing so
121,2,5eadd00ad5ea945196fab489,curiousHippo,2020-05-02T21:21:44.677Z,that's what she said but she never told us what all he has going on. She assumes she is busier than he is

122,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762fff,lightGiraffe,2020-05-02T20:06:07.496Z,She was simply telling them she felt uncomfortable and left out
122,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763591,fulfilledBear,2020-05-02T20:06:07.775Z,Although the couple should not have been having an entire conversation in a different language in front of her the parent needs to bring it up in a different way.

122,1,5d482ea221c9be351f761dbc,inspiredMonkey,2020-05-02T20:08:07.093Z,They should speak French privately.  But the mom should have expressed her opinion to her son in private.  Doing so in front of both has caused a rift.
122,1,5ead9428d5ea945196fa97c1,curiousElephant,2020-05-02T20:08:14.280Z,I think it's totally disrespectful towards the mom

124,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,fulfilledBison,2020-05-03T20:52:58.554Z,they were being exclusionary for no real reason ultimately
124,0,5eadc8b2d5ea945196fab1af,lightGorilla,2020-05-03T20:52:59.244Z,I think this person's kind of an asshole because they don't know how well the French guy speaks English.
124,0,5ead8f82d5ea945196fa9747,brightZebra,2020-05-03T20:52:59.591Z,She's not an asshole in my opinion
124,0,5ead8f82d5ea945196fa9747,brightZebra,2020-05-03T20:53:05.412Z,i agree
124,0,5eadc8b2d5ea945196fab1af,lightGorilla,2020-05-03T20:53:14.004Z,Like maybe he's only a little familiar with the language.
124,0,5eadc8b2d5ea945196fab1af,lightGorilla,2020-05-03T20:53:20.587Z,But not enough to speak it super well.
124,0,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,excitedMonkey,2020-05-03T20:53:25.824Z,lightGorilla you think there's not enough info to determine if they're the asshole?
124,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,fulfilledBison,2020-05-03T20:53:29.924Z,"well the assumption was that they could speak english decently well, since it said earlier in the post something about they could speak it"
124,0,5eae1466d5ea945196fad7a2,curiousOtter,2020-05-03T20:53:32.922Z,"I think she is, but I’m willing to be convinced"
124,0,5ead8f82d5ea945196fa9747,brightZebra,2020-05-03T20:53:38.545Z,i agree
124,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,fulfilledBison,2020-05-03T20:53:40.298Z,but if they couldn't speak it super well its not crazy to think that yeah
124,0,5eadc8b2d5ea945196fab1af,lightGorilla,2020-05-03T20:53:42.813Z,"Yeah, I just think there needs to be more info."
124,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,fulfilledBison,2020-05-03T20:53:46.371Z,true y
124,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,fulfilledBison,2020-05-03T20:53:47.642Z,ye
124,0,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,excitedMonkey,2020-05-03T20:53:51.498Z,I also assumed they mentioned that there was enough information that they could have made an attempt
124,0,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,excitedMonkey,2020-05-03T20:54:20.216Z,"Instead of storming off, maybe they could have said ""sorry my english is bad"" or if it's that poor of english, have his partner say it."
124,0,5eaf28ced5ea945196fadef0,delightedElephant,2020-05-03T20:54:20.767Z,"Being disrespectful comes across wrong, but if they had said that they would appreciate if they were all able to talk in a language everyone understands, that's different"
124,0,5ead8f82d5ea945196fa9747,brightZebra,2020-05-03T20:54:30.696Z,i agree
124,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,fulfilledBison,2020-05-03T20:54:34.677Z,yeah i mean just giving it a try isn't really that difficult
124,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,fulfilledBison,2020-05-03T20:54:39.403Z,no need to storm off
124,0,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,excitedMonkey,2020-05-03T20:54:52.437Z,"BTW, does anyone here actually read r/amitheasshoe before today? lol I got super hyped when I saw that's what this was about"
124,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,fulfilledBison,2020-05-03T20:55:12.435Z,yeah i read /r/amitheasshole every once in a while
124,0,5ead8f82d5ea945196fa9747,brightZebra,2020-05-03T20:55:15.123Z,he needs to remember he's a guest at the house
124,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,fulfilledBison,2020-05-03T20:55:19.755Z,was surprised to see a HIT doing something relevant to me
124,0,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,excitedMonkey,2020-05-03T20:55:28.584Z,lol yeah
124,0,5eadc8b2d5ea945196fab1af,lightGorilla,2020-05-03T20:55:31.459Z,"Yeah I agree that the husband probably shouldn't have stormed off. That was a bit extreme,"
124,0,5eae1466d5ea945196fad7a2,curiousOtter,2020-05-03T20:55:41.261Z,He is so young tho
124,0,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,excitedMonkey,2020-05-03T20:55:47.244Z,Does being a guest in a house have as far of implications as to the language you'll be required to use?
124,0,5ead8f82d5ea945196fa9747,brightZebra,2020-05-03T20:55:57.951Z,yes the husband should have not stormed off.
124,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,fulfilledBison,2020-05-03T20:56:22.054Z,eh i don't think there's generally like a set language or anything but if you're the guest i don't think its unreasonable to expect people to at least include you in conversation
124,0,5eadc8b2d5ea945196fab1af,lightGorilla,2020-05-03T20:56:22.813Z,"In the US generally guests are considered to be at the top of the totem pole of the household, but that doesn't mean they can be rude."
124,0,5eae1466d5ea945196fad7a2,curiousOtter,2020-05-03T20:56:29.668Z,He may have overreacted but I think she was being unnecessarily dramatic 
124,0,5eadc8b2d5ea945196fab1af,lightGorilla,2020-05-03T20:56:50.131Z,I think we seem to be in agreement that they're both the asshole lol.
124,0,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,excitedMonkey,2020-05-03T20:56:52.663Z,"If OP (original poster) commented in a negative way, I think there's more justification for them to be upset, BUT I read it assuming it was said playfully like ""hey u guys im feeling excluded :( wanna include me?"""
124,0,5ead8f82d5ea945196fa9747,brightZebra,2020-05-03T20:56:59.451Z,i mean all people think differant but he should have not stormed off.
124,0,5ead8f82d5ea945196fa9747,brightZebra,2020-05-03T20:57:51.756Z,i do not believe this person is an asshole.

124,0,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,excitedMonkey,2020-05-03T20:58:20.046Z,good work team
124,1,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,fulfilledHorse,2020-05-03T21:06:46.835Z,"NTA. I doubt OP's SO is *always* in every single conversation, so I'd assume that OP would also have plenty of time to catch up with his mother and discuss things where his husband is not always around for. "
124,1,5eae1466d5ea945196fad7a2,novelBear,2020-05-03T21:06:52.155Z,Hello
124,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,brightElephant,2020-05-03T21:06:54.563Z,hi
124,1,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,fulfilledHorse,2020-05-03T21:06:57.674Z,"Similarly, I think OP's mother could have made more of an effort as well other than just getting upset."
124,1,5ead8f82d5ea945196fa9747,inquisitiveCamel,2020-05-03T21:06:58.609Z,Hi
124,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,brightElephant,2020-05-03T21:07:09.664Z,agreed pretty much fulfilledHorse
124,1,5eadc8b2d5ea945196fab1af,livelyZebra,2020-05-03T21:07:11.586Z,I think the son is kind of an asshole because he could do more to include his mom in the conversation in a compromising way. 
124,1,5eadc8b2d5ea945196fab1af,livelyZebra,2020-05-03T21:07:26.523Z,Like maybe teach his mom common German words and phrases.
124,1,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,fulfilledHorse,2020-05-03T21:07:27.505Z,"livelyZebra I do agree with this, but I wish there was more info"
124,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,brightElephant,2020-05-03T21:07:40.816Z,yeah maybe he could try to speak english but its really not easy to tell how much english he knows
124,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,brightElephant,2020-05-03T21:07:44.672Z,or how uncomfortable it is
124,1,5eae1466d5ea945196fad7a2,novelBear,2020-05-03T21:08:00.365Z,I think he is the asshole. He could make an effort to include his ma and his hubs. 
124,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,brightElephant,2020-05-03T21:08:13.498Z,ultimately though the question is if the wife is the asshole right
124,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,brightElephant,2020-05-03T21:08:24.762Z,i think she is trying to keep people's best interests in mind at least
124,1,5eaf28ced5ea945196fadef0,inspiredGorilla,2020-05-03T21:08:25.568Z,"He could do a bit more to include his mom, sure. But also, I feel overall the mom is being a bit too defensive. This feels like a bit more like misunderstanding from both sides"
124,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,brightElephant,2020-05-03T21:08:26.768Z,not really an asshole
124,1,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,fulfilledHorse,2020-05-03T21:08:29.513Z,brightElephant what do you mean by this?
124,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,brightElephant,2020-05-03T21:08:55.457Z,"novelBear says ""he is the asshole"" but the question was if OP was the asshole, OP = the wife"
124,1,5eadc8b2d5ea945196fab1af,livelyZebra,2020-05-03T21:09:00.683Z,I agree with inspiredGorilla
124,1,5ead8f82d5ea945196fa9747,inquisitiveCamel,2020-05-03T21:09:14.102Z,"You have to remember,they're just there for the weekend and he hasn't seen his mother in a long time. he should have let his husband know that he meant no disrespect to him,but he wants to include his mother as much as possible"
124,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,brightElephant,2020-05-03T21:09:25.243Z,yeah kinda true
124,1,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,fulfilledHorse,2020-05-03T21:09:27.134Z,"who is the wife though? There's the mother, the mother's son, and the mother's son's husband"
124,1,5eadc8b2d5ea945196fab1af,livelyZebra,2020-05-03T21:09:46.420Z,"I understand where the husband is coming from, though."
124,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,brightElephant,2020-05-03T21:10:07.259Z,"am i reading incorrectly? i thought it was the wife, the husband, and the wife's mom"
124,1,5eaf28ced5ea945196fadef0,inspiredGorilla,2020-05-03T21:10:24.253Z,"I feel like the husband's SO is preferential of German to OP, but he'd be somewhat ok with English if it's the three of them"
124,1,5ead8f82d5ea945196fa9747,inquisitiveCamel,2020-05-03T21:10:29.497Z,"yea but remember , he's only there for a weekend and hasn't seen his mother in some time."
124,1,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,fulfilledHorse,2020-05-03T21:10:31.279Z,"Son (25 M), husband (23 M)"

124,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,brightElephant,2020-05-03T21:10:53.235Z,"ahhh, misread sorry bout that, meant the son then"
124,1,5eadc8b2d5ea945196fab1af,livelyZebra,2020-05-03T21:11:11.059Z,Agreed novelBear
124,1,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,fulfilledHorse,2020-05-03T21:11:24.244Z,"This is hard, I have no experience with dating someone who spoke another language. I'd imagine it's difficult. If possible I'd vote this as NAH. (No assholes here)"
124,1,5eadc8b2d5ea945196fab1af,livelyZebra,2020-05-03T21:11:34.529Z,Yeah

124,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,brightElephant,2020-05-03T21:11:37.148Z,its really hard to say
124,1,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,fulfilledHorse,2020-05-03T21:11:39.529Z,"I think it's just an awkward situation for all, and attempts could be made by all parties"

124,1,5d482eab21c9be351f7640b8,brightElephant,2020-05-03T21:11:47.469Z,yup
124,1,5ead8f82d5ea945196fa9747,inquisitiveCamel,2020-05-03T21:11:50.056Z,yes i agree. He probably should of put forth a little more effort to pleasing everyone.
124,1,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,fulfilledHorse,2020-05-03T21:12:09.006Z,"I'm sure this survey is going to make us all vote whether he's an asshole or if the other party is the asshole, with no middle ground."
124,1,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,fulfilledHorse,2020-05-03T21:12:21.116Z,yup...
124,1,5eadc8b2d5ea945196fab1af,livelyZebra,2020-05-03T21:12:44.659Z,"Yeah, it does. I'm going to stick with him being an asshole, even if it's just a mild asshole because he could've included his mom more."
124,1,5eab40f6d5ea945196f9629b,fulfilledHorse,2020-05-03T21:13:13.313Z,I still think that OP could have had time along with his mom

125,0,5f1323b02ce4916932608302,livelyCamel,2020-07-18T16:54:23.994Z,I think he is an asshole too
125,0,5f13236a2ce49169326082ef,novelMonkey,2020-07-18T16:54:24.029Z,"Same, I don't think the guy is an asshole. "
125,0,5f13236a2ce49169326082ef,novelMonkey,2020-07-18T16:54:37.140Z,I just thought that he should have told his mom about it.
125,0,5f13237e2ce49169326082f7,excitedGiraffe,2020-07-18T16:54:41.232Z,I think he is because he is not trying to speak in a mix of English and German. 
125,0,5f13237e2ce49169326082f7,excitedGiraffe,2020-07-18T16:54:50.184Z,Or yes I agree he should have told his mom
125,0,5f1323102ce49169326082e3,eagerHippo,2020-07-18T16:54:56.352Z,"I mean, it's a tough situation, right? Either way, he's choosing a language that is less comfortable for one of them. So, he really can't win."
125,0,5f13236a2ce49169326082ef,novelMonkey,2020-07-18T16:55:09.609Z,"True, true"
125,0,5f1323102ce49169326082e3,eagerHippo,2020-07-18T16:55:11.097Z,"Yeah, he definitely should've talked to his mom about it."
125,0,5f1322522ce49169326082c9,curiousDolphin,2020-07-18T16:55:14.278Z,yes.. its a tough situation
125,0,5ee122b6896280243c134057,brightHorse,2020-07-18T16:55:15.491Z,I don't think the mom was in the right because she was left out of the conversation
125,0,5f1323b02ce4916932608302,livelyCamel,2020-07-18T16:55:17.363Z,"He should take steps to include his mother, its not difficult. I have been in that situation myself"

127,1,5f18bece46a7f03dda99cad8,inquisitiveBison,2020-07-22T23:46:40.149Z,"parent is the asshole. based on what they said, they didn't say there were ground rules about speaking english in the house prior or if they were actually included in the coversation"
127,1,5f18c65846a7f03dda99d9c5,fulfilledCamel,2020-07-22T23:46:51.793Z,Ok but pretend in your in the situation 
127,1,5f18c65846a7f03dda99d9c5,fulfilledCamel,2020-07-22T23:46:58.379Z,Like you want to be included
127,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b92,excitedOtter,2020-07-22T23:46:59.847Z,Kids are often self centered even when they become adults. 
127,1,5f18c65846a7f03dda99d9c5,fulfilledCamel,2020-07-22T23:47:01.412Z,And he asked
127,1,5f18bece46a7f03dda99cad8,inquisitiveBison,2020-07-22T23:47:22.036Z,Was the conversation already happening and the parent walked in?
127,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b92,excitedOtter,2020-07-22T23:47:35.483Z,Being asked to be included is not asshole material
127,1,5f18bece46a7f03dda99cad8,inquisitiveBison,2020-07-22T23:47:39.210Z,or was the kid speaking french to the parent?
127,1,5f18c1e446a7f03dda99d07c,novelGorilla,2020-07-22T23:47:42.066Z,"If you're staying with someone, it's only fair you speak to them/around them in a way they can understand"
127,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b92,excitedOtter,2020-07-22T23:47:45.089Z,even if it was said in a snarky manner
127,1,5f18c1e446a7f03dda99d07c,novelGorilla,2020-07-22T23:47:54.655Z,It says they were all in the living room together not that the dad walked in
127,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763b92,excitedOtter,2020-07-22T23:48:10.990Z,"Therefore parent not asshole, kid not necessarily asshole, but definitely selfish"
127,1,5f18bece46a7f03dda99cad8,inquisitiveBison,2020-07-22T23:48:21.169Z,the kid is also 20
127,1,5f18bece46a7f03dda99cad8,inquisitiveBison,2020-07-22T23:48:37.694Z,the parent didn't say if the conversation was directed at the parent or not
127,1,5f18c65846a7f03dda99d9c5,fulfilledCamel,2020-07-22T23:48:47.287Z,wow the kid is 20 and married
127,1,5f18bece46a7f03dda99cad8,inquisitiveBison,2020-07-22T23:48:49.922Z,maybe the parent interjected and just wanted to be the center of attention
127,1,5f18c1e446a7f03dda99d07c,novelGorilla,2020-07-22T23:49:01.338Z,you can assume if they are all in a room together it would be a general discussion....
127,1,5f18c65846a7f03dda99d9c5,fulfilledCamel,2020-07-22T23:49:01.798Z,"Wait so is parent asshole, Y or N"

127,1,5f18c65846a7f03dda99d9c5,fulfilledCamel,2020-07-22T23:50:01.559Z,So i guess only one person saying yes
127,1,5f18c65846a7f03dda99d9c5,fulfilledCamel,2020-07-22T23:50:05.649Z,can we convince you?
127,1,5f18bece46a7f03dda99cad8,inquisitiveBison,2020-07-22T23:50:08.798Z,I would conceded that they are both assholes. The parent didn't explain their story enough
127,1,5f18c1e446a7f03dda99d07c,novelGorilla,2020-07-22T23:50:33.577Z,"we're not instigating about the full story, we are coming to a decision based off of information given"
127,1,5f18bece46a7f03dda99cad8,inquisitiveBison,2020-07-22T23:50:46.023Z,to me it sounds like the kid was a typical 20yo asshole and the parent didn't explain their case well enough
127,1,5f18c1e446a7f03dda99d07c,novelGorilla,2020-07-22T23:51:03.148Z,you're making assumptions outside of the provided text though
127,1,5f18c65846a7f03dda99d9c5,fulfilledCamel,2020-07-22T23:51:03.177Z,I said no 
127,1,5f18bece46a7f03dda99cad8,inquisitiveBison,2020-07-22T23:51:29.625Z,so we are taking the parent at face value?
127,1,5f18bece46a7f03dda99cad8,inquisitiveBison,2020-07-22T23:51:35.768Z,that's their testimony 
127,1,5f18c1e446a7f03dda99d07c,novelGorilla,2020-07-22T23:51:39.738Z,yes I mean idk why we wouldnt
127,1,5f18c65846a7f03dda99d9c5,fulfilledCamel,2020-07-22T23:51:55.408Z,not everyone voted again
127,1,5f18c65846a7f03dda99d9c5,fulfilledCamel,2020-07-22T23:52:00.613Z,:D
128,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7634ee,excitedCamel,2020-07-22T23:15:10.210Z,After reading though I think she is the asshole because her husband understands and speaks english.
128,1,5f18bbe046a7f03dda99c932,openElephant,2020-07-22T23:15:12.258Z,The daughter was right in wanting to make her husband feel comfortable. 
128,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7635df,curiousGorilla,2020-07-22T23:15:15.849Z,I think the boyfriend should have made more effort to speak in English in respect for the mother.
128,1,5f18bd6646a7f03dda99c9f5,inquisitiveHorse,2020-07-22T23:15:26.773Z,"I can understand both points in this situation. His husband feels more comfortable, but he needs to think of his mom who has not seen in a while."
128,1,5f18bbe046a7f03dda99c932,openElephant,2020-07-22T23:15:37.320Z,The mother should not of reacted the way she did. 
128,1,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c924,inspiredBear,2020-07-22T23:15:40.400Z,My initial impression is this person is the asshole. They went to visit the mother and to not include her in the conversation is rude
128,1,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c923,lightDolphin,2020-07-22T23:15:44.217Z,Ya she can speak whatever language she wants but she should speak more english to include her mother. 
128,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763428,brightMonkey,2020-07-22T23:15:49.252Z,I think the son was right in speaking German to the husband. How would the mom feel in Germany?
128,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7634ee,excitedCamel,2020-07-22T23:16:06.501Z,If they are alone or in Germany it makes sense to speaks german but if they are around english speakers they should speak english if they can.
128,1,5f18bd6646a7f03dda99c9f5,inquisitiveHorse,2020-07-22T23:16:19.844Z,"I think it would be fine to speak in German when the mom is not around, but speak in English when the mom is around. Otherwise, why even visit her?"
128,1,5f18bbe046a7f03dda99c932,openElephant,2020-07-22T23:16:22.413Z,They could of found a middle ground. 
128,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7635df,curiousGorilla,2020-07-22T23:16:22.424Z,I agree with excitedCamel
128,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763428,brightMonkey,2020-07-22T23:16:25.618Z,I think that he could have maybe tried to help his husband be more comfortable speaking english.
128,1,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c924,inspiredBear,2020-07-22T23:16:33.551Z,This person also makes the situation seem he has to choose between the mother and husband. In reality he can be encouraging toward the husband to use his english and include the mother in the conversation
128,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7634ee,excitedCamel,2020-07-22T23:16:41.744Z,If it the other way around the husbands mom would expect german to be spoken I am sure. 
128,1,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c923,lightDolphin,2020-07-22T23:16:56.287Z,Ya there should be some sort of hybrid model
128,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763428,brightMonkey,2020-07-22T23:17:01.850Z,What if she doesn't know German though?
128,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7635df,curiousGorilla,2020-07-22T23:17:06.305Z,The mom absolutely shouldn't have responded the way she did and could have handled it a little more assertively.
128,1,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c924,inspiredBear,2020-07-22T23:17:36.650Z,"If they weren't there specifically to visit the mother it might be different, but what's the point of visiting if you arent going to include her?"
128,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7634ee,excitedCamel,2020-07-22T23:17:49.288Z,Because all three can speak English it is the obvious choice while with the mother. 
128,1,5f18bd6646a7f03dda99c9f5,inquisitiveHorse,2020-07-22T23:17:54.890Z,"Yes, why visit her if they are not going to talk to her?"
128,1,5f18bbe046a7f03dda99c932,openElephant,2020-07-22T23:18:08.628Z,I’m sure they could of communicated well enough if she translated for her mother. 
128,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7635df,curiousGorilla,2020-07-22T23:18:25.413Z,Is the mom supposed to sit there hearing German the entire time?
128,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763428,brightMonkey,2020-07-22T23:18:26.001Z,"That does make sense. If they are there to see her, the son could have translated for his husband."
128,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7635df,curiousGorilla,2020-07-22T23:18:38.813Z,She might as well have ditched the both of them and gone to Germany at this point.
128,1,5f18bd6646a7f03dda99c9f5,inquisitiveHorse,2020-07-22T23:18:45.767Z,"The husband may feel uncomfortable speaking English, but I am sure he is in a non judgmental environment with people that could help him if he didn't understand anything."
128,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763428,brightMonkey,2020-07-22T23:19:03.727Z,It would be a good place to practice his English.
128,1,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c923,lightDolphin,2020-07-22T23:19:08.031Z,Ya the husband is mostly at fault here for being scared
128,1,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c924,inspiredBear,2020-07-22T23:19:14.531Z,I think the best solution is for them to be more encouraging about their husbands english. Like inquisitiveHorse said it was most likely a non judgemental environment
128,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763428,brightMonkey,2020-07-22T23:19:25.001Z,I agree with ins
128,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763428,brightMonkey,2020-07-22T23:19:30.026Z,inspiredBear
128,1,5f18bbe046a7f03dda99c932,openElephant,2020-07-22T23:19:51.910Z,He is a guest. Make him feel comfortable. 
128,1,5f18bbe046a7f03dda99c932,openElephant,2020-07-22T23:20:19.601Z,I don’t think he is an asshole. 
128,1,5f18bbe046a7f03dda99c932,openElephant,2020-07-22T23:20:27.267Z,Others?
128,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7635df,curiousGorilla,2020-07-22T23:20:38.213Z,I think they are the asshole.
128,1,5f18bd6646a7f03dda99c9f5,inquisitiveHorse,2020-07-22T23:20:48.109Z,"Yes, I do think he is because he was not considerate of his mother, who they were there to visit."
128,1,5d482ea821c9be351f763428,brightMonkey,2020-07-22T23:20:51.521Z,"I think he is the asshole, but not on purpose. I think there were a lot of other ways to have made him not the asshole that he didn't do."
128,1,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c924,inspiredBear,2020-07-22T23:20:54.194Z,"I think the person is the asshole, maybe the mom over-reacted but they were rude to her in the first place."
128,1,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c923,lightDolphin,2020-07-22T23:20:59.823Z,They all are at fault
128,1,5f18bbe046a7f03dda99c932,openElephant,2020-07-22T23:21:07.787Z,True 
128,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7635df,curiousGorilla,2020-07-22T23:21:20.777Z,Don't forget to vote.
128,2,5f18bbe046a7f03dda99c932,curiousZebra,2020-07-22T23:29:41.814Z,The mother is the subject?
128,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7634ee,delightedMonkey,2020-07-22T23:29:57.278Z,I think that the mother approached the situation poorly making her the asshole.
128,2,5f18bd6646a7f03dda99c9f5,fulfilledHorse,2020-07-22T23:29:57.419Z,I don't think the mother was in the wrong at all.
128,2,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c924,novelCamel,2020-07-22T23:30:00.660Z,"Yeah the mother is the subject, I think they are the asshole in this situatio"
128,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763428,brightGiraffe,2020-07-22T23:30:04.539Z,I feel like the mom is not the asshole. She was kind about asking for them to speak english.
128,2,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c923,openOtter,2020-07-22T23:30:23.696Z,Ya it's her house they should make an effort to include her. 
128,2,5f18bbe046a7f03dda99c932,curiousZebra,2020-07-22T23:30:25.079Z,She is correct in wanting them to speak English but she could of approached it better. 
128,2,5f18bd6646a7f03dda99c9f5,fulfilledHorse,2020-07-22T23:30:25.264Z,She wanted to talk to the men and asked them to include her. They decided to get mad about it.
128,2,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c923,openOtter,2020-07-22T23:30:42.544Z,Ya they overreacted inside of just talking it out
128,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763428,brightGiraffe,2020-07-22T23:30:42.730Z,I think the son's partner was the asshole and the son was supporting him too much instead of his mom.
128,2,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c924,novelCamel,2020-07-22T23:30:47.265Z,"In my opinion, it seemed like she didnt give them a chance before saying they were being disrespectful."
128,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7635df,livelyBear,2020-07-22T23:30:54.485Z,She could have worded it more assertively and politely.
128,2,5f18bbe046a7f03dda99c932,curiousZebra,2020-07-22T23:31:04.160Z,To speak dominantly in the language is inappropriate. 
128,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7634ee,delightedMonkey,2020-07-22T23:31:05.920Z,I dont think its wrong that they wanted English but to jump right to saying she is disrespected instead of asking them to switch to english made it weird.
128,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7635df,livelyBear,2020-07-22T23:31:17.668Z,She could have asked them to try and speak English when she's around so she can be included.
128,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763428,brightGiraffe,2020-07-22T23:31:20.650Z,It would be interesting to see how long they'd been there.
128,2,5f18bbe046a7f03dda99c932,curiousZebra,2020-07-22T23:31:35.430Z,It was childish for the one to storm away. 
128,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7634ee,delightedMonkey,2020-07-22T23:31:38.431Z,She made everyone feel awkward when that wasn't necessary. 
128,2,5d482ea821c9be351f763428,brightGiraffe,2020-07-22T23:31:45.759Z,I feel like the son and his partner overreacted by going upstairs.
128,2,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c924,novelCamel,2020-07-22T23:31:48.133Z,For all we know the partner was just asking for the right words to say in english. She said that he does speak english but we dont know how well.
128,2,5f18bd6646a7f03dda99c9f5,fulfilledHorse,2020-07-22T23:31:48.341Z,It is rude to speak in a language the mother does not understand in front of her. They were excluding her.
128,2,5f18bbe046a7f03dda99c932,curiousZebra,2020-07-22T23:31:54.781Z,I’m sure there is more to this than what was written. 
128,2,5d482ea821c9be351f7634ee,delightedMonkey,2020-07-22T23:32:09.522Z,If she were nice about it I think it would have played out differently.
128,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7635df,livelyBear,2020-07-22T23:32:15.654Z,It's not like she was sitting there being ignored while they were speaking French to each other.
128,2,5f18bbe046a7f03dda99c932,curiousZebra,2020-07-22T23:32:17.727Z,Definitely an over reaction. 
128,2,5d482ea921c9be351f7635df,livelyBear,2020-07-22T23:32:22.120Z,She walked in on them speaking French.

130,2,5f18bbea46a7f03dda99c933,curiousDolphin,2020-07-22T23:19:54.701Z,This reminds me of the first AITA except from the Mother's point of view (and French ha)

130,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763e16,eagerZebra,2020-07-22T23:20:17.658Z,The mother is not an asshole
130,2,5ee16cf8896280243c138460,delightedElephant,2020-07-22T23:20:22.515Z,I don't think she was impolite about it

130,2,5f18bc3a46a7f03dda99c94b,openCamel,2020-07-22T23:20:33.280Z,"So I think the son is being the asshole because they were all sitting together, the husband can speak English, why wouldn't they just speak English?"
130,2,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c925,brightHorse,2020-07-22T23:20:34.925Z,I am a lttle conflicted because this wouldn't be a coversation at all if her delviery wasn't off
130,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ed6,inquisitiveOtter,2020-07-22T23:20:35.558Z,"I dont think the mother is an ass, but the so is"
130,2,5f18bbea46a7f03dda99c933,curiousDolphin,2020-07-22T23:20:38.580Z,I think that the couple was actively putting up a boundary so that they didn't have to be involved with small talk.
130,2,5f18bc7646a7f03dda99c960,excitedBear,2020-07-22T23:20:39.059Z,"She may have THOUGHT she explained gently and nicely, but it may not have been taken that way. Still, it's a reasonable request."
130,2,5ee16cf8896280243c138460,delightedElephant,2020-07-22T23:20:39.719Z,if you're in the room with someone else it's only right to ensure they can participate in coversation
130,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763ed6,inquisitiveOtter,2020-07-22T23:20:41.961Z,but the son is
130,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763934,inspiredMonkey,2020-07-22T23:20:43.675Z,I don't think she was an asshole at all. She was kind about it
130,2,5f18bbea46a7f03dda99c933,curiousDolphin,2020-07-22T23:21:00.471Z,There is quite the room for misunderstanding tact with a language barrier.
130,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763e16,eagerZebra,2020-07-22T23:21:01.813Z,She was very nice.
130,2,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c925,brightHorse,2020-07-22T23:21:05.700Z,She immediately went on the offensive and I think that's where the problem arose. I think she's right to want to be included though
130,2,5f18bc3a46a7f03dda99c94b,openCamel,2020-07-22T23:21:07.979Z,I agree delightedElephant

130,2,5ee16cf8896280243c138460,delightedElephant,2020-07-22T23:21:14.949Z,yeah it's possible she is thinking she was more polite than she is

130,2,5f18bbea46a7f03dda99c933,curiousDolphin,2020-07-22T23:24:54.984Z,It's hard to give space you're not used to when you've spent someone's whole life being their support system. I'm sure that's a shock as well.
130,2,5f18ba6446a7f03dda99c925,brightHorse,2020-07-22T23:25:01.266Z,I wonder if it would've made any difference if the mother had asked the son in private (instead of in the moment in front of the partner)
130,2,5f18bc7646a7f03dda99c960,excitedBear,2020-07-22T23:25:05.089Z,"It was the son's role to smooth out the situation between the two of them, and he failed that."

132,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763e5d,inspiredMonkey,2020-07-22T23:00:09.830Z,Clearly the husband and wife need to communicate better and get on the same page about things

132,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763dab,openZebra,2020-07-22T23:02:28.229Z,The wife should think about how her husband feels as well.

132,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763dab,openZebra,2020-07-22T23:02:55.577Z,They definitely need to communicate better.

133,2,5f19811046a7f03dda9a0c13,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-07-23T13:19:52.459Z,it is rude to have a conversation that makes a party of the conversation feel left out especially in his house

133,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f96,fulfilledBear,2020-07-23T13:21:50.202Z,Even though they made her just as uncomfortable as she did them
133,2,5f19803e46a7f03dda9a0c0a,brightGiraffe,2020-07-23T13:21:57.224Z,But we do have the right to communicate in what ever language right?

133,2,5f19811046a7f03dda9a0c13,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-07-23T13:22:40.719Z,the son and partner are the asshole because they could have taken excuse to go have their conversation in privacy

133,2,5d482eab21c9be351f763f96,fulfilledBear,2020-07-23T13:23:51.469Z,I think in the end she is the asshole because the ball was in her court she could have pulled the son aside.
133,2,5f19803e46a7f03dda9a0c0a,brightGiraffe,2020-07-23T13:24:04.989Z,I'm on this too

134,2,5ea8745c7d50722703c528b9,fulfilledCamel,2020-07-23T13:01:17.726Z,Your husband should use this opportunity to learn English phrases and innuendos better. It is a great time since he is with family.
134,2,5f18c35646a7f03dda99d40d,livelyMonkey,2020-07-23T13:01:21.977Z,I do not believe the daughter is an asshole because she is accommodating her husband.

134,2,5f13239c2ce49169326082fd,delightedBison,2020-07-23T13:02:18.985Z,OP could include her mother in the conversation by interpreting things for her.

134,2,5f18cc4846a7f03dda99ed0a,inspiredDolphin,2020-07-23T13:02:52.934Z,I get that too 
134,2,5f18c82446a7f03dda99dff3,eagerGorilla,2020-07-23T13:02:59.947Z,I was in the same situation with my first husband (they were all Japanese) and my siL would interpret everything for me.

134,2,5f18c35646a7f03dda99d40d,livelyMonkey,2020-07-23T13:05:08.309Z,The daughter does need to find a way that she can speak to them both but in this scenario I do not feel that she was an asshole.

134,3,5f13239c2ce49169326082fd,fulfilledGiraffe,2020-07-23T13:15:52.479Z,I think OP is an asshole; she should be more worried about making her son's husband feel comfortable than being included in a single conversation.
134,3,5f18c82446a7f03dda99dff3,openCamel,2020-07-23T13:15:53.277Z,I think the son is the asshole here. His husband is taking his cues from him. The polite thing to do is speak the language of your host (if you can) when around them. No one should feel excluded.
134,3,5f18c35646a7f03dda99d40d,eagerZebra,2020-07-23T13:15:57.868Z,So the mom is not the asshole.

135,0,5e7e4efc31f4e454e196c986,novelBear,2020-07-23T13:06:56.493Z,Agreed.  It was inconsiderate of them as her guests to exclude her from the conversation.

135,2,5ebca97c78f5b8169eccbc45,eagerMonkey,2020-07-23T13:31:42.102Z,I think she should encourage the husband 
135,2,5f1982d246a7f03dda9a0cd2,brightZebra,2020-07-23T13:31:53.081Z,but wasn't necessary for the mom to called her daughter an asshole

136,0,5f18b78046a7f03dda99c868,novelHippo,2020-07-23T16:27:59.477Z,yeah i agree

136,0,5f1322fc2ce49169326082e1,inspiredDolphin,2020-07-23T16:28:20.552Z,Yes but he is overthinking himself

136,0,5f18b78046a7f03dda99c868,novelHippo,2020-07-23T16:28:46.091Z,Ok
136,0,5f19adfc46a7f03dda9a2b7c,brightGiraffe,2020-07-23T16:28:48.279Z,Duolingo is easy and super fun. You'll at least learn some basics.

136,0,5f1322fc2ce49169326082e1,inspiredDolphin,2020-07-23T16:29:06.712Z,I can conclude that he is not an asshole
136,0,5f19adfc46a7f03dda9a2b7c,brightGiraffe,2020-07-23T16:29:15.954Z,Not an asshole in my opinion. He's just stressed being a full time translator on top of his job. 
136,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7632c5,openZebra,2020-07-23T16:29:54.287Z,I think not the asshole. He's stressed having taken on a responsibility he didn't ask for.
136,0,5f1322fc2ce49169326082e1,inspiredDolphin,2020-07-23T16:29:56.897Z,He is not asshole but he may try to understand the situation of others. He should not trouble others.

136,3,5f19adfc46a7f03dda9a2b7c,delightedBison,2020-07-23T17:08:36.211Z,Hello. My first impression is that she is reasonable. 
136,3,5f19afd246a7f03dda9a2e1b,eagerHippo,2020-07-23T17:08:48.057Z,"Me, too! del"
136,3,5f1322fc2ce49169326082e1,livelyMonkey,2020-07-23T17:08:50.597Z,"I think, the person in the scenario is not asshole"
136,3,5f19adfc46a7f03dda9a2b7c,delightedBison,2020-07-23T17:08:53.395Z,I feel like the husband slightly overreacted.
136,3,5f19a73046a7f03dda9a2584,lightHorse,2020-07-23T17:09:00.151Z,I don't think it should be expected of him to have to help like that.
136,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7632c5,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-23T17:09:05.960Z,I think this one is tough. While I don't think their husband should have to serve as translator I don't think it's right to just suggest they should learn english and stop bothering him because he was able to learn spanish.
136,3,5f19a73046a7f03dda9a2584,lightHorse,2020-07-23T17:09:06.479Z,It would be nice.
136,3,5f19b28446a7f03dda9a3368,brightElephant,2020-07-23T17:09:07.168Z,I think it should be her responsibility to translate for her mom and not her husbands. 
136,3,5f1322fc2ce49169326082e1,livelyMonkey,2020-07-23T17:09:14.684Z,Of course you are true lightHorse
136,3,5f19a73046a7f03dda9a2584,lightHorse,2020-07-23T17:09:17.256Z,But he should not be forced to. 
136,3,5f19afd246a7f03dda9a2e1b,eagerHippo,2020-07-23T17:09:20.829Z,She is just wants her husband to help while she is busy getting her Master’s.
136,3,5f19adfc46a7f03dda9a2b7c,delightedBison,2020-07-23T17:09:24.022Z,"He doesn't have to help that much, though. Ten minutes at a time isn't bad."
136,3,5f19b2ac46a7f03dda9a3427,novelGorilla,2020-07-23T17:09:24.741Z,Not an asshole at all
136,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7632c5,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-23T17:09:27.641Z,I agree with brightElephant
136,3,5f19adfc46a7f03dda9a2b7c,delightedBison,2020-07-23T17:09:41.945Z,"He shouldn't be the only one helping, but she definitely isn't an asshole."
136,3,5f19a73046a7f03dda9a2584,lightHorse,2020-07-23T17:09:55.113Z,"It would make their lives so much easier if they used the resources to learn. They'd make everyone's life easier, including their own"
136,3,5f19afd246a7f03dda9a2e1b,eagerHippo,2020-07-23T17:10:07.615Z,I think it's reasonable for a husband to help a wife.
136,3,5f1322fc2ce49169326082e1,livelyMonkey,2020-07-23T17:10:10.395Z,She should not have to trouble her husband
136,3,5f19b28446a7f03dda9a3368,brightElephant,2020-07-23T17:10:11.199Z,"It's unfortunate that he doesn't want to help, but the mother should try to learn."
136,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7632c5,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-23T17:10:12.825Z,I think they should both probably help or otherwise find some method of dividing up helping the mother.
136,3,5f19b28446a7f03dda9a3368,brightElephant,2020-07-23T17:10:19.776Z,Agreed.
136,3,5f19adfc46a7f03dda9a2b7c,delightedBison,2020-07-23T17:10:22.532Z,It's not like he has to help every single moment of every day. 
136,3,5f1322fc2ce49169326082e1,livelyMonkey,2020-07-23T17:10:37.677Z,One should not avoid the responsibility
136,3,5f18b78046a7f03dda99c868,curiousDolphin,2020-07-23T17:10:39.237Z,"I pass it onto my husband, since he also speaks Spanish and currently has more free time. After a while she's basically just started calling him directly whenever she has a problem."
136,3,5f19afd246a7f03dda9a2e1b,eagerHippo,2020-07-23T17:10:49.883Z,It's really hard to learn new language the older you get.
136,3,5f19a73046a7f03dda9a2584,lightHorse,2020-07-23T17:10:49.896Z,"It is very reasonable for a husband to help a wife, but she shouldn't just force stuff on him, and call him privileged because he suggests resources that would help them"
136,3,5f19b28446a7f03dda9a3368,brightElephant,2020-07-23T17:10:58.262Z,"They should find some sort of happy medium, maybe go through her first and if she can't get it then go to her husband?"
136,3,5f19adfc46a7f03dda9a2b7c,delightedBison,2020-07-23T17:11:19.619Z,Yes I agree him offering help was rational.  
136,3,5f19afd246a7f03dda9a2e1b,eagerHippo,2020-07-23T17:11:19.812Z,brightElephant I agree.
136,3,5f1322fc2ce49169326082e1,livelyMonkey,2020-07-23T17:11:30.962Z,Its a reasonable one but he should do that from his heart and not by the pressure by his wife
136,3,5f19b28446a7f03dda9a3368,brightElephant,2020-07-23T17:11:31.833Z,"The mother should also try to learn at least a little bit, enough to get through the day."
136,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7632c5,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-23T17:11:33.776Z,"Yeah, I think there's a way to settle this without making it about the husband needing to be the only one helping."
136,3,5f19adfc46a7f03dda9a2b7c,delightedBison,2020-07-23T17:12:01.761Z,"Overall, they need to compromise, but neither one of them is an ASSHOLE."
136,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7632c5,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-23T17:12:07.036Z,I think the mother learning would be good and maybe prodviding her with resources would help in addition to the two helping out the mother in law.
136,3,5f19a73046a7f03dda9a2584,lightHorse,2020-07-23T17:12:17.874Z,"I do not think that every one should be forced to speak the same language, but in this case, where theyre having to call for help, it would just be so much helpful for their own sake to learn."
136,3,5f1322fc2ce49169326082e1,livelyMonkey,2020-07-23T17:12:33.675Z,They may take step to compromise
136,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7632c5,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-23T17:12:39.064Z,I'm kinda leaning towards NTA.

136,3,5f1322fc2ce49169326082e1,livelyMonkey,2020-07-23T17:12:57.723Z,I agree
136,3,5f19afd246a7f03dda9a2e1b,eagerHippo,2020-07-23T17:13:03.023Z,They could help them with interpreting sources online an phone apps.
136,3,5f18b78046a7f03dda99c868,curiousDolphin,2020-07-23T17:13:09.762Z,That was good
136,3,5f19a73046a7f03dda9a2584,lightHorse,2020-07-23T17:13:21.908Z,"Asshole is a strong word, but I do not think she should be upset with him for being irritated."

138,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7632a5,livelyGorilla,2020-07-23T15:56:49.407Z,I kind of feel like everyone is an asshole in this situation
138,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7632eb,openCamel,2020-07-23T15:57:03.856Z,I can see where the mom is coming from-she hasn't seen her son and wants to be part of his life.
138,1,5f19a7b246a7f03dda9a2595,curiousZebra,2020-07-23T15:57:07.573Z,I think the best way that his husband could get more comfortable with English would be to use this time to speak it with the family.
138,1,5f18bcf846a7f03dda99c96e,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-23T15:57:25.072Z,Me too but I think he’s the asshole.
138,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f5e,brightOtter,2020-07-23T15:57:28.643Z,I think she could find a way to bridge the gap between her mom and husband so they both felt included.
138,1,5f19a88e46a7f03dda9a26c0,fulfilledMonkey,2020-07-23T15:57:31.948Z,"I agree^ especially because the mom is being so gracious to house them and feed them, wanting to have a conversation isn't a crazy demand"
138,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7632eb,openCamel,2020-07-23T15:57:34.600Z,"I agree, some patient conversation among all parties would be helpful."
138,1,5f18bcf846a7f03dda99c96e,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-23T15:57:38.349Z,He could have translated for the mom
138,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7632a5,livelyGorilla,2020-07-23T15:57:40.714Z,Exactly
138,1,5f19a7b246a7f03dda9a2595,curiousZebra,2020-07-23T15:57:42.636Z,"Being anywhere and not feeling comfortable in the language of that country is hard, so I feel for the husband."
138,1,5f1986ec46a7f03dda9a0f75,novelElephant,2020-07-23T15:57:46.035Z,"I kind of agree. However, I think if the author is staying at his mom’s house, he should at least have the decency to include her in the conversation."
138,1,5f19a89846a7f03dda9a26c2,eagerHippo,2020-07-23T15:58:00.540Z,"I feel like the poster here is being a bit of an asshole.  If his husband doesn't feel comfortable with english, but poster is comfy with both then poster should translate for his mother."
138,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7632eb,openCamel,2020-07-23T15:58:09.282Z,"It is hard for both the mom and the husband-either way, one of them feels left out."
138,1,5f19a7b246a7f03dda9a2595,curiousZebra,2020-07-23T15:58:11.005Z,"But mom deserves to be part of the conversation, especially since she's being so kind in hosting them."
138,1,5f19a88e46a7f03dda9a26c0,fulfilledMonkey,2020-07-23T15:58:20.857Z,"the husband does know english though, and the husband should want to use this time to get closer to his MIL i feel"
138,1,5f18bcf846a7f03dda99c96e,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-23T15:58:28.600Z,Then everyone could have participated If they just had sometranslation
138,1,5f19a7b246a7f03dda9a2595,curiousZebra,2020-07-23T15:58:52.554Z,Exactly what inspiredGiraffe said
138,1,5f1986ec46a7f03dda9a0f75,novelElephant,2020-07-23T15:58:58.753Z,Author needs to stop making it about “sides” and just translate for everyone. 
138,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7632a5,livelyGorilla,2020-07-23T15:59:05.658Z,I agree
138,1,5f19a89846a7f03dda9a26c2,eagerHippo,2020-07-23T15:59:07.697Z,"Yeah, like the husband could speak english until he doesn't know the right word and use the german one, poster can translate that for mother."
138,1,5f18bcf846a7f03dda99c96e,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-23T15:59:18.835Z,Agreed. Sides never work out well in family
138,1,5d482eab21c9be351f763f5e,brightOtter,2020-07-23T15:59:20.078Z,The wife should have compromised to make both feel comfortable. Translating or helping husband with unknown words.
138,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7632eb,openCamel,2020-07-23T15:59:22.225Z,I agree-author could bridge the gap between everyone.
138,1,5f19a88e46a7f03dda9a26c0,fulfilledMonkey,2020-07-23T15:59:24.943Z,OP could also definitely encourage the husband to try to practice more and say that his mom wouldn't judge him or etc
138,1,5f19a7b246a7f03dda9a2595,curiousZebra,2020-07-23T15:59:27.353Z,Better to ask questions if a misunderstanding comes up than to leave someone out of the conversation completely.
138,1,5f19a89846a7f03dda9a26c2,eagerHippo,2020-07-23T15:59:42.862Z,exactly
138,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7632eb,openCamel,2020-07-23T15:59:47.697Z,It's a lot about respect.
138,1,5f18bcf846a7f03dda99c96e,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-23T15:59:48.329Z,"Agree,zebra"
138,1,5f1986ec46a7f03dda9a0f75,novelElephant,2020-07-23T15:59:55.208Z,"Agreed, curiousZebra"
138,1,5f19a7b246a7f03dda9a2595,curiousZebra,2020-07-23T16:00:08.183Z,Good point openCamel
138,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7632eb,openCamel,2020-07-23T16:00:45.680Z,"If they really cared about each other, they would be patient and understanding."
138,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7632eb,openCamel,2020-07-23T16:01:04.301Z,Just ask questions and make it clear that no one is going to judge anyone for misunderstandings.
138,1,5f19a88e46a7f03dda9a26c0,fulfilledMonkey,2020-07-23T16:01:18.054Z,maybe OP could teach the mom a few common german greetings/sayings so husband could feel more welcomed and in return he'd be more willing to speak english
138,1,5f19a7b246a7f03dda9a2595,curiousZebra,2020-07-23T16:01:19.375Z,"Exactly.  And it isn't stated, but I have a feeling that is why mom thinks her son is being an asshole right now"
138,1,5f1986ec46a7f03dda9a0f75,novelElephant,2020-07-23T16:01:51.173Z,I would have the same feelings if I were the mom
138,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7632eb,openCamel,2020-07-23T16:01:51.611Z,OP is def. in the position to make the most change.
138,1,5f18bcf846a7f03dda99c96e,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-23T16:01:52.197Z,I agree. No judgements necessary. They can find a common ground if the son could act as a bridge
138,1,5f19a89846a7f03dda9a26c2,eagerHippo,2020-07-23T16:02:10.127Z,so would I.
138,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7632eb,openCamel,2020-07-23T16:02:57.542Z,"I think if we agree OP has the ability to bridge the communication gap, he should. That would make him the ass if he isn't."
138,1,5f19a7b246a7f03dda9a2595,curiousZebra,2020-07-23T16:03:11.697Z,Exactly

138,1,5f19a89846a7f03dda9a26c2,eagerHippo,2020-07-23T16:03:18.068Z,precisely how I feel
138,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7632a5,curiousGiraffe,2020-07-23T16:26:41.055Z,I don't feel like the poster is an asshole
138,3,5f19a89846a7f03dda9a26c2,inquisitiveElephant,2020-07-23T16:26:56.541Z,I feel like the author is not the asshole here.  I do think it's a big deal to exclude someone from the conversation in their own home.
138,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7632eb,brightCamel,2020-07-23T16:27:04.969Z,I don't think mom is the ass.
138,3,5f18bcf846a7f03dda99c96e,fulfilledHorse,2020-07-23T16:27:06.686Z,My initial impression I’d she’s a little bit of an asshol
138,3,5f19a7b246a7f03dda9a2595,openBison,2020-07-23T16:27:06.801Z,I think the son is the asshole here... OP was just wanted to be included in a conversation that was being had while she was in the room.
138,3,5f18bcf846a7f03dda99c96e,fulfilledHorse,2020-07-23T16:27:30.671Z,I just think she could have phrased her objection a little differently 
138,3,5f19a88e46a7f03dda9a26c0,excitedOtter,2020-07-23T16:27:32.363Z,yea i mean maybe she could have privately said something to OP
138,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7632eb,brightCamel,2020-07-23T16:27:33.623Z,Son can speak both languages-he should bridge the communication gap.
138,3,5d482eab21c9be351f763f5e,delightedHippo,2020-07-23T16:27:34.018Z,I do think the mom could have approached it better. 
138,3,5f18bcf846a7f03dda99c96e,fulfilledHorse,2020-07-23T16:27:50.109Z,Maybe she could have asked to be includes
138,3,5f1986ec46a7f03dda9a0f75,lightBear,2020-07-23T16:27:51.349Z,"I also don’t feel like the poster is an asshole. He seemingly made his feelings aware in a polite way, and the son just went off the deep end"
138,3,5f18bcf846a7f03dda99c96e,fulfilledHorse,2020-07-23T16:28:00.191Z,Or asked for her son to translate 
138,3,5f19a88e46a7f03dda9a26c0,excitedOtter,2020-07-23T16:28:02.327Z,i get that the partner may have felt awkward / like OP was blaming them
138,3,5f19a89846a7f03dda9a26c2,inquisitiveElephant,2020-07-23T16:28:04.419Z,"Yeah, the author is slightly an asshole, but I think the son telling her it's no big deal puts him more into that camp than the author."
138,3,5f19a7b246a7f03dda9a2595,openBison,2020-07-23T16:28:09.388Z,"I mean, maybe the phrasing could be different, but I don't OP is an asshole for it."
138,3,5f19a88e46a7f03dda9a26c0,excitedOtter,2020-07-23T16:28:20.012Z,but i don't think her request was unreasonable
138,3,5f19a88e46a7f03dda9a26c0,excitedOtter,2020-07-23T16:28:30.118Z,yea i agree

138,3,5f19a7b246a7f03dda9a2595,openBison,2020-07-23T16:28:40.606Z,Everyone in the room speaks English.  Son could have translated if there was an issue in understanding.
138,3,5f19a89846a7f03dda9a26c2,inquisitiveElephant,2020-07-23T16:28:51.917Z,precisely
138,3,5f18bcf846a7f03dda99c96e,fulfilledHorse,2020-07-23T16:28:52.574Z,Agreed the son is the bigger asshole but I think when she led with them being disrespectful it was never going to end well
138,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7632a5,curiousGiraffe,2020-07-23T16:29:11.459Z,"I feel like it is just polite, in a small group like this, to make sure that everyone in the room can be included"

138,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7632a5,curiousGiraffe,2020-07-23T16:29:16.930Z,Kind of common sense

138,3,5f1986ec46a7f03dda9a0f75,lightBear,2020-07-23T16:29:19.642Z,Totally true about the mom

139,0,5f19a8ac46a7f03dda9a26c6,eagerGiraffe,2020-07-23T15:39:11.883Z,I think a polite request would be to talk to her son in private rather than confront her son's partner.
139,0,5f19a83446a7f03dda9a25ef,brightDolphin,2020-07-23T15:39:16.962Z,"She should have spoken with her son privately about the issue, rather than interrupting their conversation. Again, it may be very challenging for him to speak English conversationally."

139,0,5f19a7bc46a7f03dda9a2596,openOtter,2020-07-23T15:41:04.072Z,she is right to say that

139,0,5f19a83446a7f03dda9a25ef,brightDolphin,2020-07-23T15:41:48.198Z,I still consider her to be the asshole because of how she handled the situation.
139,0,5f19a80246a7f03dda9a25e9,inspiredBear,2020-07-23T15:41:52.221Z,I agree

139,0,5f19a8ac46a7f03dda9a26c5,excitedHorse,2020-07-23T15:42:20.889Z,I think 'asshole' in any sense is kind of harsh here.  Especially with different cultures in a room.
139,2,5f19a80246a7f03dda9a25e9,curiousDolphin,2020-07-23T16:05:43.288Z,I think that this person is the asshole

139,2,5f19a8ac46a7f03dda9a26c5,inquisitiveGiraffe,2020-07-23T16:06:45.802Z,It would be different were they at a hotel with non-family.  
139,2,5f19a7bc46a7f03dda9a2596,novelElephant,2020-07-23T16:06:51.512Z,i think she is the asshole because her mother feel intimidated because she don’t understand anything and she look strange to her since it been long you are away from her

139,2,5f19a7a846a7f03dda9a2593,inspiredHippo,2020-07-23T16:07:43.530Z,She should have balanced and maybe told the husband to try speak  in a common language

141,0,5ebca97278f5b8169eccbc44,delightedGorilla,2020-07-23T15:26:06.334Z,My initial impression is that this guy is TA. I don't see how he can justify not speaking English when he is visiting his mother. He is around his husband 24/7 but he only visits his mother every so often. 
141,0,5ebca97278f5b8169eccbc44,delightedGorilla,2020-07-23T15:26:48.805Z,"However, I see how he would not want to make his husband uncomfortable or make him feel like he has to speak English if he is not comfortable doing so. "
141,0,5ebca97278f5b8169eccbc44,delightedGorilla,2020-07-23T15:27:07.601Z,"My thought is that the husband does not have to participate in conversation with they are speaking English unless he wants to, but that when the mom is out of the room, they can just speak German. "
141,0,5eab24aed5ea945196f95bc9,livelyElephant,2020-07-23T15:27:11.737Z,"Completely agree.  If you are going to live with your mother at her own gesture, she should be included in the conversation.  The german has the ability to speak English, so there's really no reasoning for it."
141,0,5f18c2f246a7f03dda99d2ec,fulfilledMonkey,2020-07-23T15:27:12.785Z,"I agree, in that I think he is TA. I think, his mother was kind enough to host them. I think as a sign of appreciation he should also make her feel comfortable."

141,0,5ebca97278f5b8169eccbc44,delightedGorilla,2020-07-23T15:27:42.332Z,"Right, he should at least be able to understand English and chime in if he really wants to"
141,0,5eab24aed5ea945196f95bc9,livelyElephant,2020-07-23T15:27:47.894Z,Correct! Only has some trouble speaking it - not that he can't speak it.  
141,0,5f18c9a046a7f03dda99e50c,inspiredHippo,2020-07-23T15:27:51.479Z,The German husband doesn't have to speak. He can listen/understand English while the American speaks to both of them (mom and hubby).

141,0,5f18c2f246a7f03dda99d2ec,fulfilledMonkey,2020-07-23T15:28:48.965Z,I think it's unfortunate that it was a missed opportunity for her husband and mother to get to know each other better. And he could have been the bridge to help them both.

141,0,5eab24aed5ea945196f95bc9,livelyElephant,2020-07-23T15:29:31.576Z,Agreed! The mother doesn't know German - only the husband and wife.  They call all speak English and her mother wants to be involved.

141,2,5eab24aed5ea945196f95bc9,novelHorse,2020-07-23T15:57:17.638Z,Good analogy. Having three people in the room and and two texting is disrespectful.  The same applies here.

142,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762c9f,delightedZebra,2020-07-24T00:21:27.257Z,I thing that the guy is sort of stuck between a rock and a hard place trying to please two different people.
142,0,5f18c59a46a7f03dda99d805,inspiredDolphin,2020-07-24T00:21:33.527Z,I think she's in the wrong here
142,0,5f18c48246a7f03dda99d597,excitedElephant,2020-07-24T00:21:46.342Z,The mans mom was nice enough to make them comfortable in her house his husband and himself should have been nice enough back to talk in English and include her. 
142,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762c9f,delightedZebra,2020-07-24T00:21:51.313Z,I feel like the mom and husband need to figure out some sort of compromise.
142,0,5f1a21f646a7f03dda9a6b99,fulfilledMonkey,2020-07-24T00:21:59.515Z,I think the girl and mother are hosts herald should be considerate to the guy
142,0,5f18c59a46a7f03dda99d805,inspiredDolphin,2020-07-24T00:22:01.599Z,true exactly. Also he speaks English whereas the mom doesn't know any German at all
142,0,5eaca6e4d5ea945196fa62b0,lightCamel,2020-07-24T00:22:02.741Z,Yeah I'd say he's in the wrong. At least his husband can speak SOME english.
142,0,5eade946d5ea945196fac5d7,openBison,2020-07-24T00:22:12.949Z,"I understand the complexity of the situation. Isolating a host that is giving you food, shelter, and is your mum makes me believe she is in the wrong."
142,0,5f18c59a46a7f03dda99d805,inspiredDolphin,2020-07-24T00:22:13.258Z,Exactly
142,0,5f18c59a46a7f03dda99d805,inspiredDolphin,2020-07-24T00:22:22.832Z,I agree
142,0,5f1a1c4246a7f03dda9a657f,brightBear,2020-07-24T00:22:34.060Z,I agree as well
142,0,5f1a21f646a7f03dda9a6b99,fulfilledMonkey,2020-07-24T00:22:35.490Z,The mom should be more understanding of the situation

142,0,5eade946d5ea945196fac5d7,openBison,2020-07-24T00:22:49.893Z,It is possible to combined the language usage. 
142,0,5f18c48246a7f03dda99d597,excitedElephant,2020-07-24T00:23:00.466Z,I do have 1 question. Was the men at least translating for his mom? If not that is rude
142,0,5f18c59a46a7f03dda99d805,inspiredDolphin,2020-07-24T00:23:03.254Z,"Yeah, she can just help the husband if he has trouble"
142,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762c9f,delightedZebra,2020-07-24T00:23:16.163Z,"Ya, mom can learn a bit of german and husband can try his american more."
142,0,5f1a21f646a7f03dda9a6b99,fulfilledMonkey,2020-07-24T00:23:24.648Z,"The guy is new to the place and language , whereas Mom is comfortable in her own backyard"
142,0,5f18c48246a7f03dda99d597,excitedElephant,2020-07-24T00:23:25.556Z,Right. Plus the are married they need to get to know each other. 
142,0,5eaca6e4d5ea945196fa62b0,lightCamel,2020-07-24T00:23:27.773Z,I mean it's true the mother could be more understanding but she's not wrong.
142,0,5eade946d5ea945196fac5d7,openBison,2020-07-24T00:23:30.757Z,I did not get the impression that the mum was clued in on any discussion. 
142,0,5f18c48246a7f03dda99d597,excitedElephant,2020-07-24T00:23:59.602Z,I didn't either. Meaning that didn't even make an effort to include her. 
142,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762c9f,delightedZebra,2020-07-24T00:24:10.135Z,I don't think they translated for mom - they should
142,0,5eade946d5ea945196fac5d7,openBison,2020-07-24T00:24:26.769Z,It was behavior that excluded whether it meant to or not. 
142,0,5f18c48246a7f03dda99d597,excitedElephant,2020-07-24T00:24:28.415Z,That is why I believe he is the A hole here. 
142,0,5f1a21f646a7f03dda9a6b99,fulfilledMonkey,2020-07-24T00:24:44.585Z,I think the mom can be made to understand the situation and am sure there would be a lot of instances when the daughter -mom could catch up in private too.
142,0,5eaca6e4d5ea945196fa62b0,lightCamel,2020-07-24T00:24:48.047Z,"I deal with this kind of stuff on a weekly basis with my own mother so I can tell you, it makes her feel bad as well."

142,0,5f18c59a46a7f03dda99d805,inspiredDolphin,2020-07-24T00:25:11.956Z,The question is if the wife is the asshole
142,0,5f18c59a46a7f03dda99d805,inspiredDolphin,2020-07-24T00:25:16.622Z,not the husband
142,0,5eaca6e4d5ea945196fa62b0,lightCamel,2020-07-24T00:25:23.032Z,That's a good way to put it I suppose.
142,0,5d482ea721c9be351f762c9f,delightedZebra,2020-07-24T00:25:29.914Z,I get left out of my husband's family discussions sometimes - it sucks
142,0,5f18c48246a7f03dda99d597,excitedElephant,2020-07-24T00:25:44.286Z,I understand both sides. 
142,0,5f1a1c4246a7f03dda9a657f,brightBear,2020-07-24T00:26:18.737Z,I think this person is a hole because he should have been more respectful towards his mom

142,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762c9f,livelyGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:35:43.458Z,I think they should speak in English in respect to their hostess

142,1,5eade946d5ea945196fac5d7,delightedBear,2020-07-24T00:35:55.780Z,This is a challenging case. I do not prefer how the mum handled it.

142,1,5eade946d5ea945196fac5d7,delightedBear,2020-07-24T00:38:35.134Z,"Language is precious reflects identity, but the boyfriend was so rude. He could speak to the mum but didn't much in English."
142,1,5f18c59a46a7f03dda99d805,excitedGorilla,2020-07-24T00:38:40.216Z,"the mom needed to be included, and it really wasn't that hard to do soo"
142,1,5f1a1c4246a7f03dda9a657f,inspiredHippo,2020-07-24T00:38:58.813Z,"Was she supposed to deal with that, feeling left out the whole time instead of not saying anything?"
142,1,5f18c59a46a7f03dda99d805,excitedGorilla,2020-07-24T00:39:08.731Z,exactly. Like thats her son
142,1,5f1a1c4246a7f03dda9a657f,inspiredHippo,2020-07-24T00:39:09.541Z,Maybe not the right time to discuss her feelings
142,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762c9f,livelyGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:39:13.881Z,Maybe the partner was really nervous and shy or something??
142,1,5f18c48246a7f03dda99d597,lightMonkey,2020-07-24T00:39:21.536Z,I feel she handled it ina okay way. 
142,1,5f1a21f646a7f03dda9a6b99,brightDolphin,2020-07-24T00:39:27.952Z,"Of course, ideally, English should have been spoken, but she didn't't have to create bad feelings unnecessarily."
142,1,5eaca6e4d5ea945196fa62b0,curiousCamel,2020-07-24T00:39:28.476Z,"Yeah but it seems like the bf didn't realize he was being rude, but probably felt embarrassed to be called out like that. "
142,1,5f18c59a46a7f03dda99d805,excitedGorilla,2020-07-24T00:39:30.255Z,"Eh, she asked nicely tho, its not like she threw a tantrum"
142,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762c9f,livelyGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:39:39.214Z,I'm glad she was honest.
142,1,5eade946d5ea945196fac5d7,delightedBear,2020-07-24T00:39:39.749Z,I agree the how maybe was not executed correctly by the mum.
142,1,5eade946d5ea945196fac5d7,delightedBear,2020-07-24T00:40:08.164Z,"But she was sincere, so I can't fault her."
142,1,5f18c59a46a7f03dda99d805,excitedGorilla,2020-07-24T00:40:08.819Z,exactly she was honest. Its the son/boyfriends fault for throwing off the vibe
142,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762c9f,livelyGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:40:13.513Z,Partner needs to bring her flowers and apologize. And thank his hostess
142,1,5f18c59a46a7f03dda99d805,excitedGorilla,2020-07-24T00:40:27.368Z,exactly
142,1,5f1a1c4246a7f03dda9a657f,inspiredHippo,2020-07-24T00:40:33.427Z,I agree - that would have been the right thing to do
142,1,5f1a21f646a7f03dda9a6b99,brightDolphin,2020-07-24T00:40:33.568Z,"If she had not called them out, it would have stayed a good atmosphere…. she was the one to have been more mature in this situation"
142,1,5f18c48246a7f03dda99d597,lightMonkey,2020-07-24T00:40:34.472Z,I guess my thing is when I stay with someone else I do things with them not leave them out. 
142,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762c9f,livelyGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:40:44.151Z,"Like, who wouldn't want to make a good impression on your SO's parents?"
142,1,5eade946d5ea945196fac5d7,delightedBear,2020-07-24T00:41:05.335Z,brightDolphin if it were me I would learned some french to ask please include me I don't understand. 
142,1,5f18c48246a7f03dda99d597,lightMonkey,2020-07-24T00:41:15.620Z,I just feel that by the boyfriend not speaking to her made it okay for her to ask to be included. 
142,1,5f1a1c4246a7f03dda9a657f,inspiredHippo,2020-07-24T00:41:16.088Z,Lol - I love it!
142,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762c9f,livelyGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:41:32.437Z,The son needed to talk to his partner and tell him to show respect for his mom
142,1,5f1a21f646a7f03dda9a6b99,brightDolphin,2020-07-24T00:41:50.017Z,there is something called being a nice host… calling your guest out for a small matter… doesn't reflect that. Mom iis A
142,1,5eaca6e4d5ea945196fa62b0,curiousCamel,2020-07-24T00:41:56.919Z,I forgot to vote last time...
142,1,5f1a1c4246a7f03dda9a657f,inspiredHippo,2020-07-24T00:41:57.796Z,He shouldn't have to be told - but some people are self centered
142,1,5f18c59a46a7f03dda99d805,excitedGorilla,2020-07-24T00:42:08.555Z,bruhhh lol
143,0,5ee147e6896280243c135b3d,openZebra,2020-07-24T00:06:11.594Z,Hi all
143,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7628b6,delightedBear,2020-07-24T00:06:15.095Z,hey
143,0,5ee12306896280243c13405e,livelyGorilla,2020-07-24T00:06:25.864Z,Hi! I really didn't think anyone the asshole. They just have different opinions about their obligations to this family.
143,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763aa3,eagerDolphin,2020-07-24T00:06:26.332Z,hi
143,0,5f1a1bca46a7f03dda9a6561,novelElephant,2020-07-24T00:06:31.895Z,hi.  
143,0,5ee147e6896280243c135b3d,openZebra,2020-07-24T00:06:37.318Z,"yeah, i felt that way too"
143,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a30,lightGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:06:57.620Z,Yea the person writing was not an asshole.
143,0,5ee147e6896280243c135b3d,openZebra,2020-07-24T00:07:02.025Z,"if i had to answer I'd say No, but it sounds like they need to have better communication, and maybe set up a better system"
143,0,5f1a1bca46a7f03dda9a6561,novelElephant,2020-07-24T00:07:02.773Z,I agree.  It's reasonable for the person with more free time currently to take on the small extra task of helping out.
143,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7628b6,delightedBear,2020-07-24T00:07:12.024Z,"Yeah, I can agree with that. I think that the husband could very easily convey his feelings to the mom though. Like he could just help her learn how to figure stuff out on her own by showing her duolingo or rosetta stone and how to use them"
143,0,5ee147e6896280243c135b3d,openZebra,2020-07-24T00:07:26.804Z,Yeah good point
143,0,5f1a1bca46a7f03dda9a6561,novelElephant,2020-07-24T00:07:33.900Z,Having the mom go straight to the husband maybe not helping in their communications
143,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763aa3,eagerDolphin,2020-07-24T00:07:35.871Z,"I kind of agree with livelyGorilla but would word it more like they're both being kind of assholes lol. She shouldn't ""expect"" him to do these things just because he has more time. But his reasoning and response is really assholish. "
143,0,5f1a1bca46a7f03dda9a6561,novelElephant,2020-07-24T00:08:02.116Z,They could work together better as a team certainly
143,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a30,lightGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:08:05.172Z,Communication would be key.
143,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763aa3,eagerDolphin,2020-07-24T00:08:08.662Z,Exactly. 
143,0,5ee12306896280243c13405e,livelyGorilla,2020-07-24T00:08:09.028Z,I agree novelElephant
143,0,5ee147e6896280243c135b3d,openZebra,2020-07-24T00:08:09.707Z,Totally
143,0,5f1a1fa846a7f03dda9a68c5,excitedHorse,2020-07-24T00:08:30.762Z,Hi! I agree. They could work together.
143,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763aa3,eagerDolphin,2020-07-24T00:08:36.198Z,"but, since I think we have to choose either is or isn't the asshole I would say she is the asshole. But I mean, I understand her position. "
143,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a30,lightGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:08:37.071Z,It does seem like if i had to pin asshole on either one of them thought it would be the husband.
143,0,5f1a1bca46a7f03dda9a6561,novelElephant,2020-07-24T00:09:03.083Z,it is tough to decide degree of assholishness to each
143,0,5ee147e6896280243c135b3d,openZebra,2020-07-24T00:09:04.411Z,"yeah, he definitely said some stupid things"
143,0,5ee12306896280243c13405e,livelyGorilla,2020-07-24T00:09:17.098Z,I agree I think the husband's reaction was asshole-like.
143,0,5ee147e6896280243c135b3d,openZebra,2020-07-24T00:09:20.549Z,It's funny though because we can'
143,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7628b6,delightedBear,2020-07-24T00:09:23.097Z,Yeah I think husband too. He's being unreasonable and the mother only calls because he was obviously willing to help at one point
143,0,5ee147e6896280243c135b3d,openZebra,2020-07-24T00:09:29.830Z,Can't really judge him
143,0,5f1a1bca46a7f03dda9a6561,novelElephant,2020-07-24T00:09:38.322Z,it would be nice if she were more appreciative of the help husband was giving
143,0,5f1a1bca46a7f03dda9a6561,novelElephant,2020-07-24T00:09:56.985Z,maybe her role in being the asshole is the expectation that of course he'll do it 
143,0,5ee147e6896280243c135b3d,openZebra,2020-07-24T00:09:59.776Z,"Yeah, her tone was like she was on the attack from the get-go"
143,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763aa3,eagerDolphin,2020-07-24T00:10:06.271Z,I don't think the husband is being an asshole just for setting that boundary though. I think how he defined the boundary was assholish. But not the fact that he did. If that makes any sense. 
143,0,5ee147e6896280243c135b3d,openZebra,2020-07-24T00:10:23.465Z,Totally agree eagerDolphin
143,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a30,lightGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:10:33.687Z,At any rate someone has to be the asshole
143,0,5ee12306896280243c13405e,livelyGorilla,2020-07-24T00:10:34.566Z,"I think she should be kinder and more understanding of how stressful it can be to help. I think she should ask rather than order. But, I think that maybe he should react in a better way especially to his in-laws."
143,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7628b6,delightedBear,2020-07-24T00:10:45.739Z,"yeah that makes sense, eagerDolphin I agree with that"
143,0,5f1a1bca46a7f03dda9a6561,novelElephant,2020-07-24T00:10:49.825Z,and same on her end - reasonable to expect help but could go about it in a more respectful way
143,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763aa3,eagerDolphin,2020-07-24T00:11:02.929Z,I think the wife is the asshole for basically expecting her husband to be a translator when he is obviously annoyed by it. 
143,0,5f1a1bca46a7f03dda9a6561,novelElephant,2020-07-24T00:11:21.141Z,sounds like we think she is the asshole then?
143,0,5f1a1fa846a7f03dda9a68c5,excitedHorse,2020-07-24T00:11:31.230Z,I agree.
143,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a30,lightGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:11:33.250Z,im ok with it
143,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7628b6,delightedBear,2020-07-24T00:11:46.136Z,a mild asshole lol
143,0,5ee147e6896280243c135b3d,openZebra,2020-07-24T00:11:50.360Z,"I think so too, that she is the asshole here. Even if they have work to do on their communication, with the evidence of her post alone, I feel pretty confident"
143,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763aa3,eagerDolphin,2020-07-24T00:12:13.826Z,"Ok. So it seems we generally agree. Both parties have a point and we can see where both are coming from.  But ultimately if one person gets the title, it's the wife?"
143,2,5ee12306896280243c13405e,brightGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:35:43.134Z,Hey

143,2,5f1a1fa846a7f03dda9a68c5,eagerCamel,2020-07-24T00:35:49.644Z,Hi
143,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7628b6,delightedHorse,2020-07-24T00:35:51.714Z,hi
143,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a30,inspiredBear,2020-07-24T00:35:53.586Z,ola
143,2,5f1a1bca46a7f03dda9a6561,novelHippo,2020-07-24T00:35:59.971Z,ola :)
143,2,5ee12306896280243c13405e,brightGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:36:01.431Z,Any initial thoughts?
143,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763aa3,openElephant,2020-07-24T00:36:07.270Z,I think he's the asshole
143,2,5ee147e6896280243c135b3d,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-07-24T00:36:13.228Z,"so, I feel like this guy is the asshole"
143,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a30,inspiredBear,2020-07-24T00:36:15.712Z,I agree on him being the asshole
143,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7628b6,delightedHorse,2020-07-24T00:36:16.441Z,Definitely sounds like an asshole with his mindset
143,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a30,inspiredBear,2020-07-24T00:36:31.073Z,Also does anyone else find this post familiar at all?
143,2,5f1a1bca46a7f03dda9a6561,novelHippo,2020-07-24T00:36:32.271Z,I agree.  It is harsh to tell others to just learn a language
143,2,5ee12306896280243c13405e,brightGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:36:33.401Z,I also thought he was an asshole for the way he treated the mom and his mindset since English really isn't a national language of the U.S.
143,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763aa3,openElephant,2020-07-24T00:36:47.583Z,all of my posts have been about language barriers
143,2,5f1a1fa846a7f03dda9a68c5,eagerCamel,2020-07-24T00:36:47.726Z,I understand that he is frustrated.
143,2,5f1a1bca46a7f03dda9a6561,novelHippo,2020-07-24T00:36:48.791Z,it can come easy for some but not for others
143,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7628b6,delightedHorse,2020-07-24T00:36:50.017Z,"I kinda agree with him that she should be learning English, but it sounds like he went about it the complete wrong way"
143,2,5ee147e6896280243c135b3d,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-07-24T00:36:50.806Z,"When he flaunts his own achievements, I think he also is taking for granted his mother-in-laws age and experience"
143,2,5ee12306896280243c13405e,brightGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:36:57.236Z,Plus he sounded so arrogant when he said he learned languages in 2 years so why can't everyone else.
143,2,5f1a1bca46a7f03dda9a6561,novelHippo,2020-07-24T00:37:16.973Z,it might be ideal but not necessarily realistic
143,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763aa3,openElephant,2020-07-24T00:37:23.440Z,"Also, like...why did you learn those languages just to like...not use them? Just so you can say you can speak them?"
143,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a30,inspiredBear,2020-07-24T00:37:26.159Z,I did not like the part about telling her to get her shit together.
143,2,5ee12306896280243c13405e,brightGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:37:30.519Z,English is not a national language of the U.S. It's not a necessity to be a citizen.
143,2,5ee12306896280243c13405e,brightGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:37:42.992Z,"Sure, it's useful but to tell someone off for not knowing English is wrong"
143,2,5f1a1bca46a7f03dda9a6561,novelHippo,2020-07-24T00:37:52.539Z,it seemed like he changed his tune at the end of the story because he got backlash
143,2,5d482ea621c9be351f7628b6,delightedHorse,2020-07-24T00:38:00.489Z,"but the vast majority speak English here, so in order to adequately communicate with the majority, you need to know English"
143,2,5ee147e6896280243c135b3d,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-07-24T00:38:09.243Z,"Yeah, he has a very aggressive tone in the initial post"
143,2,5d482eaa21c9be351f763aa3,openElephant,2020-07-24T00:38:10.688Z,He didn't help himself by outing himself as a trump supporter
143,2,5ee147e6896280243c135b3d,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-07-24T00:38:16.621Z,I feel like it speaks to his personality
143,2,5ee12306896280243c13405e,brightGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:38:26.480Z,"But, it's not a requirement. He was just incredibly rude in how he interacted with the mom."
143,2,5f1a1fa846a7f03dda9a68c5,eagerCamel,2020-07-24T00:38:34.871Z,He said at the end of story that he was polite and spoke respectful tone?

145,1,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,novelDolphin,2020-07-24T00:06:32.980Z,Maybe just needs more tact.
145,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,delightedGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:06:38.477Z,"If the conversation is mutually between them, they can have it. Moving to a private space opens them to being questioned which may not be necessary."
145,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,delightedGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:06:44.618Z,The parent is too sensitive in this scenario.
145,1,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,novelDolphin,2020-07-24T00:07:07.827Z,"They're entitled to feel however they want about it, but I think some etiquette on both sides was necessary."
145,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,delightedGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:07:23.909Z,I can agree with that.
145,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764144,inspiredGorilla,2020-07-24T00:07:28.208Z,"Maybe too sensitive but I still think they can ask that ""hey, I'm right here, can we talk in a common language and not exclude me from the conversation?"""
145,1,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,novelDolphin,2020-07-24T00:07:41.272Z,"I think, ironically, the issue here is communication of feelings."
145,1,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,novelDolphin,2020-07-24T00:07:46.612Z,Or lackthereof rather.
145,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,delightedGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:07:48.586Z,That's true. It's hard to read minds and it seems that the parent wanted that.
145,1,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,novelDolphin,2020-07-24T00:08:25.957Z,Perhaps even waiting for a pause in their conversation to introduce an open topic would be appropriate and a gentle steer back into a common language.
145,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764144,inspiredGorilla,2020-07-24T00:08:44.568Z,Yeah. But I don't think the parent is an asshole
145,1,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,novelDolphin,2020-07-24T00:08:48.005Z,I don't either.
145,1,5d482eab21c9be351f764144,inspiredGorilla,2020-07-24T00:08:55.181Z,"Could have gone about it better, but it was a reasonable request"
145,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763db4,fulfilledOtter,2020-07-24T00:08:55.827Z,"Agreed, but lack of tact doesnt mean asshole"
145,1,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,novelDolphin,2020-07-24T00:09:11.417Z,Exactly.
145,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,delightedGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:10:08.028Z,"Not in a blatant, disrespectful way. Just in an overbearing way that negates responsibility to express emotions."
145,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,novelGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:33:34.330Z,The OP is trying to keep the waters calm. I don't think they are the asshole.
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:33:52.019Z,I think that she is the asshole even if she was just trying to make sure her husband felt comfortable.
145,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,novelGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:33:55.564Z,"However, people-pleasing will give the you title of asshole."
145,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763db4,delightedDolphin,2020-07-24T00:33:56.554Z,"I think he is the asshole, for not being considerate of his parents when they are guests.  There are ways to balance keeping his husband comfortable and including his mom."
145,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f15,livelyBison,2020-07-24T00:34:04.137Z,"I agree, I don't think the guy is the asshole"
145,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764144,inspiredMonkey,2020-07-24T00:34:11.495Z,I don't think they are either.
145,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,novelGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:34:12.346Z,He can have a conversation with them individually.
145,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764144,inspiredMonkey,2020-07-24T00:34:38.138Z,I'm sure when speaking English the other guy probably feels just as uncomfortable as a non-native speaker
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:34:38.221Z,I think that OP could have spent time with their mother to ensure that they were able to have meaningful conversations.
145,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,novelGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:34:41.882Z,To expect someone to speak a language they aren't confident with makes one an asshole.
145,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f15,livelyBison,2020-07-24T00:34:43.726Z,I think the mother did very little to try to be part of the conversation and just demanded and gave a sob story about how much she felt left out. She acted immature
145,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763db4,delightedDolphin,2020-07-24T00:34:53.487Z,He can also translate for brief interactions.  It's entirely possible. 
145,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,novelGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:34:55.845Z,I agree with the immaturity.
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:35:05.397Z,I don't think there's enough data to suggest the mother gave a sob story or was immature.
145,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,novelGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:35:09.039Z,"It may be possible, but that doesn't mean it's required."
145,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,novelGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:35:16.685Z,"If it is required, the parent is the asshole."
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:35:26.549Z,I think that empathy would have gone a long way here.
145,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764144,inspiredMonkey,2020-07-24T00:35:29.538Z,I think he can have a conversation with both of them in their language and not be an asshole.
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:35:37.010Z,Both from the parent and the child.
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:36:03.939Z,"I think I can understand the mom feeling disappointed, but he was trying to walk a fine line."
145,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763db4,delightedDolphin,2020-07-24T00:36:08.910Z,He could speak to both of them and be tactful about it.  Why is one persons comfort so much more important than someone elses
145,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764144,inspiredMonkey,2020-07-24T00:36:11.825Z,Yeah he was in a no-win situation.
145,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,novelGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:36:12.886Z,The fact that this is an issue in the family dynamic makes the parent the asshole. It's not disrespectful to have a conversation with your significant other.
145,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f15,livelyBison,2020-07-24T00:36:14.515Z,"He looked out for the feelings of his partner first, isn't that what a good spouse does? I don't think he was being the asshole"
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:36:21.531Z,I agree with speaking to both and having tact.
145,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,novelGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:36:27.882Z,He was in a no-win situation.
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:36:28.942Z,"I think even if he didn't mean to be, he was the asshole."
145,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,novelGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:36:41.402Z,Can't please everyone.
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:36:48.673Z,"If you please everyone, you lose."
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:36:52.751Z,"try to please, rather."
145,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764144,inspiredMonkey,2020-07-24T00:37:06.399Z,I disagree curiousElephant Was he supposed to make his spouse feel uncomfortable for the sake of his mother?
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:37:26.060Z,"No, but he also wasn't supposed to be a guest in his mother's home and make her feel left out."
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:37:33.915Z,Especially since his time is split between two countries.
145,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763db4,delightedDolphin,2020-07-24T00:37:34.845Z,You can't please everyone but that doesn't mean you have to exclude someone knowing it hurts them
145,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762f15,livelyBison,2020-07-24T00:37:38.168Z,Definitely should put the feelings of his spouse first
145,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,novelGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:37:48.348Z,"I feel if you invite guests into your home, you accommodate them. Not the other way around."
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:37:59.412Z,I can understand that viewpoint.
145,3,5d482ea721c9be351f762c60,novelGiraffe,2020-07-24T00:38:00.695Z,The mom made a bigger deal out of this than necessary.
145,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764144,inspiredMonkey,2020-07-24T00:38:09.208Z,Yeah the guy was in a no-win situation. That doesn't make him an asshole for trying to make the best of it
145,3,5d482eaa21c9be351f763db4,delightedDolphin,2020-07-24T00:38:32.867Z,inspiredMonkey I don't think he tried to make the best of it
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:38:41.622Z,"By that logic, then no one was an asshole."
145,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764144,inspiredMonkey,2020-07-24T00:38:53.905Z,There doesn't always have to be an asshole
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:38:57.899Z,Agreed
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:39:15.493Z,"Unfortunately, we still have to decide."
145,3,5d482eab21c9be351f764144,inspiredMonkey,2020-07-24T00:39:23.475Z,The story didn't say that he refused to speak English to his mother did it?
145,3,5f19b2d446a7f03dda9a3497,curiousElephant,2020-07-24T00:39:56.668Z,"No, just that he was uncomfortable using it. However, I don't think the mother had any way of knowing that unless her son communicated it."
146,0,5f1a192246a7f03dda9a6305,lightCamel,2020-07-23T23:41:41.622Z,"So, I personally think that it would not have been that difficult to include both the husband and the mother in the conversation."
146,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640fa,livelyBison,2020-07-23T23:42:03.570Z,I agree with that
146,0,5d482eab21c9be351f76424b,openGorilla,2020-07-23T23:42:10.798Z,I think it's rude to go to someone elses home and speak another language
146,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640fa,livelyBison,2020-07-23T23:42:13.969Z,Talk to the husband in German and then fill the mother in on what was said
146,0,5f13234c2ce49169326082eb,curiousHorse,2020-07-23T23:42:22.296Z,I somewhat agree in this seems to be a case where not enough effort is being put into reaching a compromise or a solution
146,0,5f1a192246a7f03dda9a6305,lightCamel,2020-07-23T23:42:30.195Z,I agree with livelyBison 
146,0,5f13228e2ce49169326082d0,delightedZebra,2020-07-23T23:42:31.569Z,"I agree, there are ways to include both the mother and husband. There are options such as google translate, etc"
146,0,5f1a1a9e46a7f03dda9a6500,eagerDolphin,2020-07-23T23:42:45.037Z,I agree openGorilla – I can't imagine going to my parents hous eand purposefully speaking so they can't undesrstand it.
146,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763ef9,excitedHippo,2020-07-23T23:42:45.788Z,"I agree, even if the husband has trouble with choosing the right words in English he could still very well translate and include both in the conversation."
146,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640fa,livelyBison,2020-07-23T23:42:47.660Z,Agreed but i dont think that makes him an asshole
146,0,5f1a1a9e46a7f03dda9a6500,eagerDolphin,2020-07-23T23:42:55.154Z,I wonder what language they speak with his German family.
146,0,5f1a192246a7f03dda9a6305,lightCamel,2020-07-23T23:42:56.113Z,"I don't think it's necessary rude to speak another language in their house, but I think it is rude to not include the mother at all."

146,0,5f1a192246a7f03dda9a6305,lightCamel,2020-07-23T23:43:28.663Z,I feel like she's not communicating enough with either of them
146,0,5d482eab21c9be351f763ef9,excitedHippo,2020-07-23T23:43:29.023Z,I don't think he's an asshole but I do think there could have been some kind of compromise that would have worked out for everyone.
146,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7631f8,brightBear,2020-07-23T23:43:29.660Z,"I think she should include both, maybe extra work on her part. Its out of respect for her mother and her house, but also include her husband."
146,0,5f13234c2ce49169326082eb,curiousHorse,2020-07-23T23:43:56.778Z,"I think it makes him an asshole, but not for the reason he thinks he might be an asshole- I sympathize with being caught in the middle but at the very least he could've sat his mom and his husband down and had them explain their feelings."
146,0,5f13228e2ce49169326082d0,delightedZebra,2020-07-23T23:44:03.680Z,yea she didn't put enough effort into including her mother even though she and her husband are guests
146,0,5f1a1a9e46a7f03dda9a6500,eagerDolphin,2020-07-23T23:44:40.616Z,"I think she's TA especially because it seems like she and her husband don't visit all the time. It's like a somewhat special occassion, so of course the mother would want to talk with both of them a lot."
146,0,5f1a1a9e46a7f03dda9a6500,eagerDolphin,2020-07-23T23:44:59.459Z,I have a hard time seeing the situation in a light in which the OP is not TA.
146,0,5d482eab21c9be351f76424b,openGorilla,2020-07-23T23:45:11.213Z,I can understand her wanting to make her new husband feel more comfortable but you have to be reasonable 
146,0,5f1a192246a7f03dda9a6305,lightCamel,2020-07-23T23:45:25.643Z,"Yeah, I agree. He should make an effort to fill in his mother on his life and make his husband feel comfortable at the same time."
146,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640fa,livelyBison,2020-07-23T23:45:39.227Z,I agree eagerDolphin and openGorilla

146,0,5d482ea821c9be351f7631f8,brightBear,2020-07-23T23:46:40.674Z,TA
146,0,5d482eab21c9be351f7640fa,livelyBison,2020-07-23T23:47:05.926Z,So is the consensus that he’s not an asshole but more effort should be made?

147,3,5f19ac6246a7f03dda9a27ef,eagerBear,2020-07-24T00:21:49.726Z,The son should talk to his partner and tell him it is an opportunity to practice his English.

147,3,5f18c56846a7f03dda99d7ab,curiousCamel,2020-07-24T00:23:30.853Z,Perhaps they are upset because she spoke to them like children (instead of like young adults)

151,2,5f1adc9046a7f03dda9a9c96,curiousGorilla,2020-07-24T14:06:30.227Z,He wants them to learn English for their own good they need to be independent.

152,0,5f1b5f4446a7f03dda9ad19a,openMonkey,2020-07-24T22:59:13.742Z,"Ultimately, I wish there was a ""neither is the asshole"" button. But since we HAVE to choose I think she is the asshole. I don't think she should expect him to translate 24/7."

156,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762e5b,inquisitiveBear,2020-07-24T21:59:10.678Z,I think that the son and his partner are wrong for speaking french in front of her when they knew that she could not understand. 
156,1,5f18c50e46a7f03dda99d6cd,eagerGorilla,2020-07-24T21:59:14.866Z,I believe this person is disruptive for barging into the conversation and calling them disrespectful.

156,1,5f1b4fcc46a7f03dda9abcf2,brightHorse,2020-07-24T21:59:35.397Z,I think that the speaker should have handled the scenario better and not have accused them of being rude immedately.
156,1,5d482ea721c9be351f762e5b,inquisitiveBear,2020-07-24T21:59:40.316Z,I do think that she could have said it to him in private instead of interrupting though.

158,0,5f1b53e646a7f03dda9abeb6,brightDolphin,2020-07-27T15:33:00.035Z,He is right that his mother in law needs to learn English since she has been living in America for 8 years.
158,0,5d482ea821c9be351f763264,lightOtter,2020-07-27T15:33:04.557Z,Also learning that she has been in the US for 8 years makes me think that she definitely could've learned more English by now if she wanted to.

160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76421a,brightDolphin,2020-07-27T15:20:22.997Z,I think its rude but I don't think it makes her an asshole 
160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76421a,brightDolphin,2020-07-27T15:20:32.947Z,I think they're stuck in a tough situation
160,1,5f1ee41646a7f03dda9af25e,excitedHippo,2020-07-27T15:20:36.892Z,They could easily speak German when they're a lone like in the room they don't have to do it at all times especially since he does speak English
160,1,5f1ee26846a7f03dda9af1ef,novelBison,2020-07-27T15:20:41.008Z,If anything she should translate what she is saying from German into English for her mom
160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76421a,brightDolphin,2020-07-27T15:20:49.288Z,That is true 
160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,openCamel,2020-07-27T15:20:53.365Z,I've been in the same situation and you can't share if you can't understand the language.
160,1,5f1ee5ec46a7f03dda9af573,lightHorse,2020-07-27T15:20:59.309Z,"If the two options are save a little face for one person and cutting off another person from the conversation entirely or make someone a little embarrassed, choosing the former is an asshole move."
160,1,5f1ee26846a7f03dda9af1ef,novelBison,2020-07-27T15:20:59.958Z,"Yes, it really excludes her mom."
160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,openCamel,2020-07-27T15:21:18.127Z,He could at least translate to his mom and it could be a learning opportunity for both of them.
160,1,5f1ee5ec46a7f03dda9af573,lightHorse,2020-07-27T15:21:21.139Z,Especially since you're cutting off your host.
160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,openCamel,2020-07-27T15:21:35.348Z,But completely disregarding her is being an asshole.
160,1,5f1ee5a646a7f03dda9af497,delightedGorilla,2020-07-27T15:21:36.312Z,"He needs to explain to his mother about how it makes the husband feel uncomfortable, and if she doesn't understand, he is not the asshole."
160,1,5f1ee26846a7f03dda9af1ef,novelBison,2020-07-27T15:21:43.122Z,cutting off mom from being a part of the conversation in her home is the asshole
160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76421a,brightDolphin,2020-07-27T15:22:02.254Z,I agree I think explaining the situation would make it a lot better 
160,1,5f1ee41646a7f03dda9af25e,excitedHippo,2020-07-27T15:22:05.305Z,Especially since the husband does understand AND speak English just not that well while the mom knows no German
160,1,5f1ee5ec46a7f03dda9af573,lightHorse,2020-07-27T15:22:06.053Z,"This also put the German husband is a bad position, it's very possible he would've liked to at least try to include the mom who's hosting for him."
160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,openCamel,2020-07-27T15:22:07.196Z,The husband is going to be in situations where he has to be around English speakers anyway.
160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76421a,brightDolphin,2020-07-27T15:22:08.045Z,but just cutting out is very rude
160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,openCamel,2020-07-27T15:22:23.965Z,They can't hang out with friends and just talk to each other it's rude.
160,1,5f1ee41646a7f03dda9af25e,excitedHippo,2020-07-27T15:22:33.475Z,Exactly Open openCamel
160,1,5f1ae39846a7f03dda9a9e46,eagerOtter,2020-07-27T15:22:33.765Z,The frames of the constitutions protect against unfounded criminal and very  rude
160,1,5f1ee41646a7f03dda9af25e,excitedHippo,2020-07-27T15:22:49.398Z,Like would they do that around his American friends? Probably not
160,1,5f1ee5a646a7f03dda9af497,delightedGorilla,2020-07-27T15:23:02.610Z,"If he doesn't explain the situation and just keeps speaking german when all three are in the room than he is being the asshole, but clearly he is considering both sides, and the husband is really important to him."
160,1,5f1ee5ec46a7f03dda9af573,lightHorse,2020-07-27T15:23:06.025Z,This all seems pretty unanimous lol
160,1,5f1ee26846a7f03dda9af1ef,novelBison,2020-07-27T15:23:13.742Z,It would be good if the  girl would translate into English when mom is around. 
160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,openCamel,2020-07-27T15:23:35.428Z, I could understand the boyfriend's hesitation but I'm the sure mom would understand and would like to learn more about him they're family now.
160,1,5f1ae39846a7f03dda9a9e46,eagerOtter,2020-07-27T15:23:39.232Z,Their jury and mother was suffer a lot

160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76421a,brightDolphin,2020-07-27T15:24:10.517Z,I think translation to English is super important
160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,openCamel,2020-07-27T15:24:11.949Z,Yes two married men not a heterosexual couple
160,1,5f1ee5a646a7f03dda9af497,delightedGorilla,2020-07-27T15:24:12.595Z,Yeah

160,1,5f1ee5a646a7f03dda9af497,delightedGorilla,2020-07-27T15:24:48.945Z,"Well then think about the husband, if he only talks in english, he'll have a hard time joining the conversation."
160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,openCamel,2020-07-27T15:24:55.136Z,Yeah it is I had partner that spoke another language and when I was around her friends I felt uncomfortable because I couldn't join the conversation
160,1,5f1ee41646a7f03dda9af25e,excitedHippo,2020-07-27T15:25:00.504Z,Yes I think the husband is TA
160,1,5f1ae39846a7f03dda9a9e46,eagerOtter,2020-07-27T15:25:17.218Z,They involve from discriminatory ground and have an effect of nullifying 
160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,openCamel,2020-07-27T15:25:17.908Z,Overall I think they both need to compromise but leaving the mother out is rude.
160,1,5f1ee5a646a7f03dda9af497,delightedGorilla,2020-07-27T15:25:21.905Z,I don't think the husband is TA
160,1,5f1ee5a646a7f03dda9af497,delightedGorilla,2020-07-27T15:25:27.367Z,It can be worked out
160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76421a,brightDolphin,2020-07-27T15:25:33.391Z,I think they need to compromise for sure but right now he is being rude
160,1,5f1ee26846a7f03dda9af1ef,novelBison,2020-07-27T15:25:43.324Z,yes compromise for sure
160,1,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,openCamel,2020-07-27T15:25:50.813Z,Yes I agree it can be worked out I agree.
160,1,5f1ae39846a7f03dda9a9e46,eagerOtter,2020-07-27T15:25:59.128Z,They behaviours become repetitive they are defined as bullying
160,1,5f1ee41646a7f03dda9af25e,excitedHippo,2020-07-27T15:26:14.296Z,"I think going to your mothers house, who's hosting you and feeding you, who you haven't seen in a while and not including her in convo is an a-hole move"
160,3,5f1ee5ec46a7f03dda9af573,delightedMonkey,2020-07-27T15:49:47.450Z,I don't think this person is an asshole for kindly asking to be involved in the conversation.
160,3,5f1ee26846a7f03dda9af1ef,inquisitiveOtter,2020-07-27T15:49:48.091Z,I don't think she is the asshole.
160,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,eagerElephant,2020-07-27T15:49:49.887Z,I don't think the mom is being a complete asshole.  Excluding people from conversations is rude.
160,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76421a,fulfilledGorilla,2020-07-27T15:50:06.346Z,I think what she is saying is very reasonable 
160,3,5f1ee26846a7f03dda9af1ef,inquisitiveOtter,2020-07-27T15:50:10.475Z,She wasn't rude when she asked them to include her
160,3,5f1ee5a646a7f03dda9af497,lightHippo,2020-07-27T15:50:10.930Z,The person is not TA because the couple are clearly excluding him from the conversation.
160,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,eagerElephant,2020-07-27T15:50:24.201Z,So she's just supposed to sit there and they have a conversation amongst themselves and she can't participate. 
160,3,5f1ee41646a7f03dda9af25e,inspiredBear,2020-07-27T15:50:34.974Z,This scenario feels a little different then the last one. I get that it's rude to exclude people from converstations in their own house I just think she should have talked to her son and had him give the info to his boo
160,3,5f1ee26846a7f03dda9af1ef,inquisitiveOtter,2020-07-27T15:50:43.822Z,her son is the asshole for not being considerate while staying there
160,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76421a,fulfilledGorilla,2020-07-27T15:50:45.793Z,I think she was also polite 
160,3,5f1ee5a646a7f03dda9af497,lightHippo,2020-07-27T15:50:50.503Z,"And he asked them to include him, and then he just storms upstairs. He's not willing to work it out. It's not the person's fault"
160,3,5f1ee5ec46a7f03dda9af573,delightedMonkey,2020-07-27T15:50:53.553Z,The son said the parent was making a big deal out of it and making people feel awkward. It doesn't sound like they made a big deal out of it and what's awkward is speaking a language some people in the room don't understand and 
160,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,eagerElephant,2020-07-27T15:50:54.363Z,That's like going to a restaurant with someone and they're speaking on their cellphone to someone else and you can't hear the conversation.
160,3,5f1ee5ec46a7f03dda9af573,delightedMonkey,2020-07-27T15:51:00.176Z,completely excluding them from the conversation.
160,3,5f1ee41646a7f03dda9af25e,inspiredBear,2020-07-27T15:51:08.277Z,True I don't think she was mean 
160,3,5f1ee26846a7f03dda9af1ef,inquisitiveOtter,2020-07-27T15:51:10.004Z,exactly eagerElephant
160,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,eagerElephant,2020-07-27T15:51:15.561Z,You're just sitting there and it's rude.
160,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76421a,fulfilledGorilla,2020-07-27T15:51:26.767Z,I think especially because its her house
160,3,5f1ee26846a7f03dda9af1ef,inquisitiveOtter,2020-07-27T15:51:40.780Z,I think what she did was completely reasonable. Especially in her own home
160,3,5f1ee41646a7f03dda9af25e,inspiredBear,2020-07-27T15:51:46.838Z,True I agree- not involving everyone in a group in the convo is rude
160,3,5f1ee41646a7f03dda9af25e,inspiredBear,2020-07-27T15:52:05.599Z,Especially in her home- all good points. 
160,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,eagerElephant,2020-07-27T15:52:10.812Z,Exactly if I was visiting someone who only speaks another language I'd try to use a translator so at least I could join in.
160,3,5f1ee5ec46a7f03dda9af573,delightedMonkey,2020-07-27T15:52:22.442Z,"What's worse if the son's partner speaks English, so they easily could've just been speaking English in the first place."
160,3,5f1ee41646a7f03dda9af25e,inspiredBear,2020-07-27T15:52:22.668Z,And the boo does speak English
160,3,5f1ee5a646a7f03dda9af497,lightHippo,2020-07-27T15:52:26.700Z,"Why are we talking about ""her""? The story was just about a father and his son and partner only speaking in French around him. He got upset for a reason and is not TA."
160,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,eagerElephant,2020-07-27T15:52:38.667Z,Exactly at inspiredBear
160,3,5f1ee26846a7f03dda9af1ef,inquisitiveOtter,2020-07-27T15:52:47.176Z,yes it's not like he can't speak any English at all
160,3,5f1ee5ec46a7f03dda9af573,delightedMonkey,2020-07-27T15:53:01.818Z,The gender of the parent wasn't revealed or hinted at in any way.
160,3,5f1ee41646a7f03dda9af25e,inspiredBear,2020-07-27T15:53:28.417Z,Oh fair I just thought it was a mom because the last one was a mom- my bad
160,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,eagerElephant,2020-07-27T15:53:39.518Z,I could see his boyfriend's side that he may be embarrassed by his accent but I'm sure the mother wouldn't care.  A lot of Americans like French accents.
160,3,5f1ee26846a7f03dda9af1ef,inquisitiveOtter,2020-07-27T15:53:39.892Z,i assumed it was a mom too
160,3,5f1ee5ec46a7f03dda9af573,delightedMonkey,2020-07-27T15:53:40.905Z,It's all good.
160,3,5f1ee5a646a7f03dda9af497,lightHippo,2020-07-27T15:53:41.428Z,"The son's husband went upstairs, refusing to talk, and the son told him he was making a big deal. It was reasonable that he felt left out and wanted to talk in English."
160,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76421a,fulfilledGorilla,2020-07-27T15:53:52.570Z,"Exactly he can speak English, even if its not great they can explain that part to the parent and say that if he doesn't understand something he can ask his partner for translation"
160,3,5f1ee5ec46a7f03dda9af573,delightedMonkey,2020-07-27T15:54:14.509Z,I think it's pretty unanimous lol
160,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,eagerElephant,2020-07-27T15:54:20.906Z,Just walking away doesn't solve anything.
160,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,eagerElephant,2020-07-27T15:54:29.788Z,I think so as well at del
160,3,5f1ee41646a7f03dda9af25e,inspiredBear,2020-07-27T15:54:45.909Z,Perfect so we agree the parent is not TA?
160,3,5f1ee5a646a7f03dda9af497,lightHippo,2020-07-27T15:54:54.915Z,"Yeah one walked away, and the other didn't want to actually talk it out. The person is not TA."
160,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76419a,eagerElephant,2020-07-27T15:55:26.648Z,So I have to agree the mom was definitely not being an asshole the son was.
160,3,5f1ee5ec46a7f03dda9af573,delightedMonkey,2020-07-27T15:55:31.227Z,You all seem like a nice group of people.

160,3,5d482eab21c9be351f76421a,fulfilledGorilla,2020-07-27T15:55:47.512Z,"The son was being unreasonable, the parent was not. "
160,3,5f1ee26846a7f03dda9af1ef,inquisitiveOtter,2020-07-27T15:55:47.639Z,yes def not being an asshole
160,3,5f1ee5ec46a7f03dda9af573,delightedMonkey,2020-07-27T15:55:51.259Z,Thanks inspiredBear

161,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7629ff,excitedCamel,2020-07-27T14:53:46.570Z,So where does everyone stand on this issue to see how much discussion there needs to be
161,0,5f1edf2046a7f03dda9aef70,curiousHorse,2020-07-27T14:54:04.807Z,"I believe that he was not an asshole, I am interested in learning what others think"
161,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762a61,fulfilledElephant,2020-07-27T14:54:07.481Z,I understand his frustration
161,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762a61,fulfilledElephant,2020-07-27T14:54:12.965Z,Not an asshole
161,0,5f1b61b046a7f03dda9ad590,livelyBison,2020-07-27T14:54:49.680Z,I think that he is not the asshole in this scenario. After 8 years I think it is fair for him to be upset that he is still having to translate for his mother in law. 
161,0,5d482ea621c9be351f762a61,fulfilledElephant,2020-07-27T14:55:05.688Z,I agree.  8 years is plenty of lead time
161,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7629ff,excitedCamel,2020-07-27T14:55:23.876Z,I feel that this comes down to a case of someone not wanting to be independent of others. I also understand that some have difficulty learning new languages especially english
161,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763c35,lightDolphin,2020-07-27T14:55:36.269Z,She did say in important circumstances they would switch. and grandparents usually arent aware. of custody days 
161,0,5d482ea621c9be351f7629ff,excitedCamel,2020-07-27T14:55:42.076Z,however living somewhere that the main language is english makes it much easier
161,0,5f1b61b046a7f03dda9ad590,livelyBison,2020-07-27T14:55:50.650Z,He also gave her learning materials which was nice of him.
161,0,5f1b61b046a7f03dda9ad590,livelyBison,2020-07-27T14:56:31.383Z,Also it makes it clear he was polite when he finally broke down and confronted her that he was polite

164,0,5ee25924896280243c139471,fulfilledGiraffe,2020-07-27T14:39:06.414Z,She should have pulled her son aside and had a conversation with him privately.
164,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7635ce,novelCamel,2020-07-27T14:39:21.233Z,"I don't think people need to view speaking foreign languages as ""disrespectful"""

164,0,5f19acb246a7f03dda9a29a9,eagerGorilla,2020-07-27T14:39:37.030Z,"i purely support for the mother, as she did nothing wrong. Even she didnt ask in anger anything like that"
164,0,5f19b1c646a7f03dda9a3270,delightedMonkey,2020-07-27T14:39:39.056Z,Pourquoi pas?
164,0,5d482ea921c9be351f7635ce,novelCamel,2020-07-27T14:39:49.603Z,But it's all about tone I suppose. It could have come across differently in person
164,0,5d482ea921c9be351f763771,lightBison,2020-07-27T14:39:54.454Z,I think she saw it as disrespectful because she was being excluded from their conversations
164,0,5f1ee01046a7f03dda9aef8b,curiousHorse,2020-07-27T14:40:20.332Z,true I also think some effort needs to be made on her part eventually to learn french 
164,0,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a0c,openOtter,2020-07-27T14:40:28.560Z,The conversation probably had nothing to do with her but the son could have given her a summary of their conversation in English for her if she was insecure about it.
164,0,5f1ee01046a7f03dda9aef8b,curiousHorse,2020-07-27T14:40:30.790Z,french is very much a part of her son's life

164,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763771,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-07-27T14:50:00.450Z,This time my initial thought is that the son is being unreasonable
164,1,5ee25924896280243c139471,lightHorse,2020-07-27T14:50:09.805Z,Definitely an asshole. 
164,1,5f19b1c646a7f03dda9a3270,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-27T14:50:09.875Z,Yes he is.
164,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7635ce,fulfilledDolphin,2020-07-27T14:50:10.749Z,I don't think that he was an asshole. But he should make an effort to catch up with his mom.
164,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a0c,delightedBear,2020-07-27T14:50:11.488Z,I don't think that this was an either or situation.  He could have make his husband comfortable and included the mother.
164,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763771,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-07-27T14:50:15.652Z,They can't speak English for one weekend?  It would be a good opportunity for practice.
164,1,5ee25924896280243c139471,lightHorse,2020-07-27T14:50:36.278Z,One weekend of uncomfortable conversation in return for meals and a place to stay.
164,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7635ce,fulfilledDolphin,2020-07-27T14:50:37.527Z,Maybe she could look at it as an opportunity to learn some German.
164,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763771,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-07-27T14:50:41.922Z,I  agree with delightedBear there was a middle ground here.
164,1,5f19acb246a7f03dda9a29a9,novelElephant,2020-07-27T14:50:42.432Z,half of the time he spends with his husband satisfying his partner
164,1,5f1ee01046a7f03dda9aef8b,excitedBison,2020-07-27T14:50:50.181Z,My first thought is the the person in question is not an asshole as he's trying to do something to make somebody happy. I think needs to to readdress the issue but he didn't do it because of evil reasons
164,1,5ee16c44896280243c1383f5,brightOtter,2020-07-27T14:50:54.408Z,I wish we had more information. I want to know if he was making any effort to clarify what they were saying for mom. That makes a big difference
164,1,5f19acb246a7f03dda9a29a9,novelElephant,2020-07-27T14:50:58.659Z,"for a while, why can;t he satisfy his mother ?"
164,1,5ee122e8896280243c13405d,livelyMonkey,2020-07-27T14:51:13.263Z,she is an asshole 
164,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a0c,delightedBear,2020-07-27T14:51:17.603Z,He could have helped translate the English words his husband didn't know rather than exclude his mother.  Asshole
164,1,5d482ea921c9be351f7635ce,fulfilledDolphin,2020-07-27T14:51:23.632Z,I agree livelyMonkey

164,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a0c,delightedBear,2020-07-27T14:51:51.173Z,I am curious also about the mom.

164,1,5f19acb246a7f03dda9a29a9,novelElephant,2020-07-27T14:52:14.239Z,it son's duty to make her understand
164,1,5ee16c44896280243c1383f5,brightOtter,2020-07-27T14:52:30.102Z,"More effort could have been made on both sides, but I don't think the son was being malicious"
164,1,5f19b1c646a7f03dda9a3270,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-27T14:52:30.592Z,This is rude guest behavior.
164,1,5ee122e8896280243c13405d,livelyMonkey,2020-07-27T14:52:34.818Z,If he can speak English then there is no need of speaking German
164,1,5d482eaa21c9be351f763a0c,delightedBear,2020-07-27T14:52:53.587Z,The son should have made all feel comfortable instead of picking sides.

164,1,5ee25924896280243c139471,lightHorse,2020-07-27T14:52:56.625Z,Both parties needed to be more understanding. The mother only had one weekend with them to catch up.
164,1,5f19acb246a7f03dda9a29a9,novelElephant,2020-07-27T14:53:03.169Z,"for half of the time, his partner is satisfies, for limited time, why can't the husband gets adjusted?"
164,1,5d482ea921c9be351f763771,inquisitiveGorilla,2020-07-27T14:53:12.933Z,If anything the husband is the asshole for making him choose between his husband and his mom.

164,1,5f1ee01046a7f03dda9aef8b,excitedBison,2020-07-27T14:53:52.556Z,I agree that some sort of middle ground should be met. either help his mother understand the general concept of the conversations beging spoken

168,1,5d482ea321c9be351f761fc8,inspiredZebra,2020-07-27T22:14:34.341Z,The racism implication comes from the fact that he is more likely to have time and resources to be able to self teach three languages than his MIL.

170,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7631e3,brightBison,2020-07-27T21:56:05.495Z,I think that the person should have considered her feelings and maybe approached it differently
170,1,5f1f401e46a7f03dda9b31b9,novelMonkey,2020-07-27T21:56:16.828Z,"I can see how op would be annoyed with the frequent requests, but I think they could've approached it with more understanding as well."
170,1,5eaddac8d5ea945196fabc70,openHorse,2020-07-27T21:56:22.491Z,Anyone who is living in a country for a significant period of time should have a solid grasp of the primary language used there

170,1,5f1f430246a7f03dda9b34a6,livelyCamel,2020-07-27T21:56:51.278Z,"I said they were in the wrong, but only because he should feel some of sort of obligation to help the mother in law out of respect."
170,1,5f1f401e46a7f03dda9b31b9,novelMonkey,2020-07-27T21:57:01.433Z,I agree that op ITA in how they handled it.

170,1,5f1f43d446a7f03dda9b3505,excitedHippo,2020-07-27T21:57:14.177Z, I'm flaunting my white privlege by doing this shit. I like this lines.
170,1,5eaddac8d5ea945196fabc70,openHorse,2020-07-27T21:57:20.897Z,It would be more understandable to me if she wasn't asking for help on a regular basis 
170,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7631e3,brightBison,2020-07-27T21:57:31.313Z,yes I agree to that.
170,1,5f1f430246a7f03dda9b34a6,livelyCamel,2020-07-27T21:57:33.117Z,It might be really hard for her.  Some people are not really good with picking up new languages.
170,1,5f1f43d446a7f03dda9b3505,excitedHippo,2020-07-27T21:57:41.668Z,I agree that.
170,1,5eaddac8d5ea945196fabc70,openHorse,2020-07-27T21:57:42.263Z,His edit made it seem like he was offering to help her learn
170,1,5f1f401e46a7f03dda9b31b9,novelMonkey,2020-07-27T21:57:44.097Z,Yeah helping the mother in law with language is the same as helping your family move or giving them a ride to the airport. It's annoying if you have to do it a lot but you still have to do it.
170,1,5d482ea821c9be351f7631e3,brightBison,2020-07-27T21:58:14.365Z,Yes I think he is not an asshole.

170,1,5eaddac8d5ea945196fabc70,openHorse,2020-07-27T21:58:39.027Z,I think the OP was within reason by saying he is tired of translating. He didn't sign up for it and even offered to help her learn the language 
170,1,5f1f43d446a7f03dda9b3505,excitedHippo,2020-07-27T21:58:46.151Z,I think very interesting that.

170,1,5f1f401e46a7f03dda9b31b9,novelMonkey,2020-07-27T22:00:07.705Z,I vote op is the asshole even if the mother in law is annoying.
170,1,5eaddac8d5ea945196fabc70,openHorse,2020-07-27T22:00:15.645Z,"It would be an asshole move if he said this early on, but 8 years is a long time "

170,1,5eaddac8d5ea945196fabc70,openHorse,2020-07-27T22:00:44.363Z,But I enjoyed hearing everyone's perspective!

170,3,5f1f401e46a7f03dda9b31b9,excitedGiraffe,2020-07-27T22:24:59.044Z,Same. It seems like op could help out more but isn't necessarily the asshole.
170,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631e3,openHippo,2020-07-27T22:25:14.896Z,So I think the son is the asshole and he should be doing things for his mom on a more frequent basis than he has the husband do. 
170,3,5f1f401e46a7f03dda9b31b9,excitedGiraffe,2020-07-27T22:25:35.227Z,I understand now why the husband in the previous scenario was so irritated.
170,3,5f1f43d446a7f03dda9b3505,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-07-27T22:25:43.802Z,I understand this survey.
170,3,5f1f430246a7f03dda9b34a6,fulfilledBison,2020-07-27T22:25:47.167Z,"If I had to say, I'd say they're the asshole.  Mostly because she said she ""makes"" the husband translate."

170,3,5eaddac8d5ea945196fabc70,brightBear,2020-07-27T22:25:54.991Z,"I lean slightly towards op being the asshole, as I think it's unfair for them to expect the husband to translate "

170,3,5d482ea821c9be351f7631e3,openHippo,2020-07-27T22:28:08.600Z,Yes I considered both sides. 
170,3,5eaddac8d5ea945196fabc70,brightBear,2020-07-27T22:28:10.072Z,And OP should be emphasizing the importance of learning the language and offering to help them out 
170,3,5f1f401e46a7f03dda9b31b9,excitedGiraffe,2020-07-27T22:28:20.781Z,"It seems like op doesn't expect the mom to try and learn the language at all, and thinks it's the husband's responsibility to translate simply because he has more time, which is on the asshole side."
170,3,5f1f430246a7f03dda9b34a6,fulfilledBison,2020-07-27T22:28:22.399Z,I think this person should not push the parents off on their husband.
170,3,5eaddac8d5ea945196fabc70,brightBear,2020-07-27T22:28:36.675Z,I agree with you excitedGiraffe
170,3,5eaddac8d5ea945196fabc70,brightBear,2020-07-27T22:29:03.639Z,OP is basically saying that the husband's time is less important than theirs

170,3,5f1f43d446a7f03dda9b3505,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-07-27T22:29:40.989Z,I agree that
170,3,5eaddac8d5ea945196fabc70,brightBear,2020-07-27T22:29:50.087Z,That is ultimately why I chose that OP is the asshole 
170,3,5f1f401e46a7f03dda9b31b9,excitedGiraffe,2020-07-27T22:29:57.289Z,I was in the middle leaning toward NTA but I think disrespecting the husband's time is an asshole move regardless of the language thing.
170,3,5eaddac8d5ea945196fabc70,brightBear,2020-07-27T22:30:36.451Z,Have you guys ever done this survey before?

170,3,5f1f43d446a7f03dda9b3505,inquisitiveMonkey,2020-07-27T22:30:51.124Z,I think this person is asshole.

177,2,5f1a214246a7f03dda9a6aad,novelGiraffe,2020-07-28T22:16:49.026Z,"It doesn't seem like the husband did any of this translation before they were married, and now the author is making him suddenly do it."
177,2,5f2096dab0aafc741f6865bb,excitedBear,2020-07-28T22:16:52.608Z,i am always the asshole...
177,2,5f18c89c46a7f03dda99e1d0,brightMonkey,2020-07-28T22:17:01.754Z,I definitely believe that both parties are at fault here.
177,2,5f1f472646a7f03dda9b3895,fulfilledZebra,2020-07-28T22:17:09.343Z,"I agree that the husband should be supportive of the wife's family and assist them, however I don't believe it needs to be solely his responsibility. "

177,2,5f1f466846a7f03dda9b37c3,delightedDolphin,2020-07-28T22:17:32.938Z,He should be supportive as family is family when they need help

177,2,5f1f472646a7f03dda9b3895,fulfilledZebra,2020-07-28T22:17:49.560Z,So is she the asshole for perhaps having a valid viewpoint but handling it wrong?  Or is he the asshole for not wanting to help out all the time?
177,2,5f2096dab0aafc741f6865bb,excitedBear,2020-07-28T22:17:55.379Z,very useful this survey...
177,2,5f1a214246a7f03dda9a6aad,novelGiraffe,2020-07-28T22:18:05.347Z,I think they are both assholes to an extent.

177,2,5f18c89c46a7f03dda99e1d0,brightMonkey,2020-07-28T22:18:37.419Z,"She's an asshole for not considering her husband's own time and extent of his ability to translate, and he could've handled the situation without having an outburst."

177,3,5f1a214246a7f03dda9a6aad,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-28T22:30:39.212Z,My initial thought is that the author here is not the asshole.
177,3,5f1f4c3046a7f03dda9b4341,fulfilledCamel,2020-07-28T22:30:40.735Z,He is the asshole. He should've been more polite at the beginning. 
177,3,5f1a214246a7f03dda9a6aad,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-28T22:30:55.599Z,In the edit he mentions that he has been polite throughout his conversations.
177,3,5f1f466846a7f03dda9b37c3,eagerElephant,2020-07-28T22:31:01.745Z,It appears that he is sincere in helping his MIL but was just venting and had perhaps a bad day
177,3,5f1f4c3046a7f03dda9b4341,fulfilledCamel,2020-07-28T22:31:08.589Z,Not the beginning.

177,3,5f1f472646a7f03dda9b3895,excitedDolphin,2020-07-28T22:31:44.919Z,"My thought is that the husband is being the asshole in this situation. I don't think there is anything wrong with encouraging the wife's family to learn English, or offering to help."
177,3,5f1a214246a7f03dda9a6aad,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-28T22:31:48.172Z,"He seemed to be venting in the beginning to Reddit, but when he was talking to them he says he was supeer polite."

177,3,5f1f472646a7f03dda9b3895,excitedDolphin,2020-07-28T22:32:28.283Z,I think he comes across as an asshole because he expresses his frustration with translating.  
177,3,5f1f466846a7f03dda9b37c3,eagerElephant,2020-07-28T22:32:29.546Z,He did offer to help his MIL

177,3,5f2096dab0aafc741f6865bb,inquisitiveBison,2020-07-28T22:35:44.034Z,bye all 
177,3,5f1f472646a7f03dda9b3895,excitedDolphin,2020-07-28T22:35:44.512Z,So do we agree the husband is being the asshole because of his emotions/ the way he expressed things? Even though he offered to help. 
177,3,5f18c89c46a7f03dda99e1d0,brightGorilla,2020-07-28T22:35:59.147Z,Agree
177,3,5f1a214246a7f03dda9a6aad,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-28T22:36:00.110Z,I don't think he is the asshole here.
177,3,5f1f4c3046a7f03dda9b4341,fulfilledCamel,2020-07-28T22:36:08.717Z,"In conclusion, in my opinion he is the asshole. He should control his emotions towards elders."
177,3,5f2096dab0aafc741f6865bb,inquisitiveBison,2020-07-28T22:36:10.715Z, i am a asshole....
177,3,5f1a214246a7f03dda9a6aad,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-28T22:36:20.949Z,"He has tried to set them up with ways for them to become independent, they didn't take any effort, and he is just venting on Reddit."
177,3,5f1f466846a7f03dda9b37c3,eagerElephant,2020-07-28T22:36:22.226Z,I think he is the asshole
177,3,5f1a214246a7f03dda9a6aad,inspiredGiraffe,2020-07-28T22:36:46.155Z,"He didn't vent to them or take up frustrations with them, but let his emotions out online."
177,3,5f2096dab0aafc741f6865bb,inquisitiveBison,2020-07-28T22:36:49.238Z,very interested
177,3,5f1f472646a7f03dda9b3895,excitedDolphin,2020-07-28T22:36:51.487Z,"I'm fine with venting on Reddit, I just don't think he should have told his mother-in-law she was frustrating him. "
177,3,5f1f466846a7f03dda9b37c3,eagerElephant,2020-07-28T22:36:56.051Z,I changed my mind because they may not be able to learn the language
