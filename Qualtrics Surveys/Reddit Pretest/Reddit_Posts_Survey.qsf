Of course its actually MY ticket, and I had to claim it. It didn't win the jackpot, but after taxes we walked away with $60k. I sat them both down and explained that I was going to save it all for college, but we could celebrate\/splurge a little. They absolutely wanted a gaming system, and Wilhelma insisted on a family vacation that was much needed. We all agreed on this, and saving the rest.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>I bought the gaming system and a bunch of games for about $1k. Wilhelma took over the vacation and insisted on a Disney World trip. The boys don't even like Disney, but it was always Wilhelma's dream to go so we went. Another $5k. Last year, Sam wanted a car. Wilhelma was pretty tired of chauffeuring them around anyway, so I agreed and spent \"his\" $4k on a car. I pay the insurance, registration, and maintenance under the agreement that he takes over driving Scott to his stuff as well. Wilhelma had no complaints about any of these purchases.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Since day 1, I've actually invested the entire winnings and never dipped into it. I've always spent my OWN money on all this stuff. I have invested better than average, and that $60k is now $100k. Wilhelma knows I have always invested our money, but it was always small amounts since we're poor. She knows I was investing the lottery winnings as well. I've always told her about the money doing well, but I guess I never explicitly said how well. She also has never asked, as she has left our finances completely up to me.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Sam is starting college in a few weeks, and we figured out a plan to stretch his $30k over the 4 years. While looking at the portfolio, Wilhelma noticed it was at $100k and asked how. I told her I invested the $60k and grew it to $100k. She then asked why we're only giving Sam $30K when it should be $50k. I said no, the other $40k is mine. I managed this account, I made the investments, I did all of the work. Plus I paid for all that other stuff through our other savings. The $40k stays and I'll keep investing it. If the boys NEED the money, its there, but if not I'm gonna eventually retire a little early with it. She thinks I'm stealing \"his\" money since I wouldn't have been able to invest with it if I didn't have it to begin with. I say its always kinda been my money, and I'm still giving him the $30k I promised him since the beginning.<\/div>","DataExportTag":"lottery_investment","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAVR","SubSelector":"TX","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"I have a wife (Wilhelma, 40) and two sons (Sam, 17, and Scott, 16). 6 years ago, I ran to the gas...","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"\"Yes, this person is the asshole\""},"2":{"Display":"\"No, this person is not the asshole\""}},"ChoiceOrder":[1,2],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"OFF","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":3,"NextAnswerId":1,"QuestionID":"QID35","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false}}},{"SurveyID":"SV_5vSHXzLkoklNsOh","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID10","SecondaryAttribute":"I just moved into a newish neighborhood where the homes on the south side of the street have been...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div>I just moved into a newish neighborhood where the homes on the south side of the street have been built for about three years and the homes on the north side are just being built now.

My father-in-law thought his coworkers words were so comforting he would share with me a few days after, \"maybe you lost her so you could have a grandson.\" This pissed me off to no end, but what hurts the most is that they never asked her name. They do not want to know their first grandchild's name. My husband said it is because it makes them sad so they don't want to think about it. She is never mentioned or acknowledged.<\/div><div>Now on Valentine's day of this year we were able to welcome our little rainbow, also a little girl. My in-laws love her and are absolutely thrilled when they video chat with her.

She was soaking and shivering and we were the closest house to bring her to. Everyone else in the house was immediately ready to dump her into a shelter or something but I didn\u2019t want to let it happen. I took care of her when everyone else called her ugly and asked me and my gf when we were getting rid of her. Fast forward to a couple months ago. I had just returned from visiting family back home to find that my cat is pregnant! She gave birth not long after I returned but it\u2019s been a busy few weeks so I\u2019ve been away. She gave birth to four adorable little kittens roughly three weeks ago and only this past week have I been able to be here with her and them. A few days ago I\u2019m talking with my gf\u2019s mom and she casually mentions that once the kittens are six weeks old they don\u2019t need their mother anymore. I stiffened up initially but wrote it off as her just sharing a fact I might not have known. Then yesterday my gf\u2019s brother mentions to her that while we were away, he and his girlfriend came into our room with their mother and picked out which kitten they\u2019re going to take. This sparks a conversation in the room about which kitten everyone wants. I stayed silent. I talked to my gf about it and explained that since no one wanted my cat, they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to pick and choose which of her kittens they want to take from her. As far as I am concerned, they\u2019re all mine. However this leaves me feeling a bit selfish and I don\u2019t know if I should feel that way or not.
